<h2>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION</h2>


<p>It is most gratifying to both author and publishers
that the first edition of "The Practical
Book of Oriental Rugs" has been so quickly exhausted.
Its rather remarkable sale, in spite of the
fact that within the past decade, no less than seven
books on the subject have been printed in English,
proves that it is the practical part of the book that
appeals to the majority.</p>

<p>The second edition has been prepared with the
same practical idea paramount and quite a few
new features have been introduced.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The color plates have been increased from ten
to twenty; a chapter on Chinese rugs has been inserted;
descriptions of three more rugs have been
added and numerous changes and additions have
been made to the text in general.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg. 4]</a></span></p>


<h2><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Oriental rugs have become as much a necessity
in our beautiful, artistic homes as are the
paintings on the walls and the various other works
of art. Their admirers are rapidly increasing,
and with this increased interest there is naturally
an increased demand for more reliable information
regarding them.</p>

<p>The aim of the present writer has been practical&mdash;no
such systematized and tabulated information
regarding each variety of rug in the market
has previously been attempted. The particulars
on identification by prominent characteristics
and detail of weaving, the detailed chapter
on design, illustrated throughout with text cuts,
thus enabling the reader to identify the different
varieties by their patterns; and the price per
square foot at which each variety is held by retail
dealers, are features new in rug literature. Instructions
are also given for the selection, purchase,
care and cleaning of rugs, as well as for
the detection of fake antiques, aniline dyes, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg. 5]</a></span></p>

<p>In furtherance of this practical idea the illustrations
are not of museum pieces and priceless
specimens in the possession of wealthy collectors,
but of fine and attractive examples which with
knowledge and care can be bought in the open
market to-day. These illustrations will therefore
be found of the greatest practical value to modern
purchasers. In the chapter on famous rugs some
few specimens illustrative of notable pieces have
been added.</p>

<p>In brief, the author has hoped to provide within
reasonable limits and at a reasonable price a
volume from which purchasers of Oriental rugs
can learn in a short time all that is necessary
for their guidance, and from which dealers and
connoisseurs can with the greatest ease of reference
refresh their knowledge and determine points
which may be in question.</p>

<p>For many valuable hints the author wishes to
acknowledge indebtedness to the publications referred
to in the bibliography; to Miss Lillian
Cole, of Sivas, Turkey; to Major P. M. Sykes, the

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Just when the art of weaving originated is an
uncertainty, but there seems to be a consensus of
opinion among archÃ¦ologists in general that it
was in existence earlier than the 24th century
before Christ. The first people which we have
been able with certainty to associate with this art
were the ancient Egyptians. Monuments of
ancient Egypt and of Mesopotamia bear witness
that the products of the hand loom date a considerable
time prior to 2400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and on the tombs
of Beni-Hassan are depicted women weaving
rugs on looms very much like those of the Orient
at the present time. From ancient literature we
learn that the palaces of the Pharaohs were ornamented
with rugs; that the tomb of Cyrus, founder
of the ancient Persian monarchy, was covered
with a Babylonian carpet and that Cleopatra was
carried into the presence of CÃ¦sar wrapped in a
rug of the finest texture. Ovid vividly described
the weaver's loom. In Homer's Iliad we find these
words: "Thus as he spoke he led them in and
placed on couches spread with purple carpets
o'er." The woman in the Proverbs of Solomon
said, "I have woven my bed with cords, I have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg. 18]</a></span>
covered it with painted tapestry from Egypt."
Job said: "My days are swifter than the weaver's
shuttle and are spent without hope." Other
places in the Bible where reference is made to
the art of weaving are, Ex. 33, 35, Sam. 17, 7,
and Isa. 38, 12. Besides Biblical writers, Plautus,
Scipio, Horace, Pliny and Josephus all speak
of rugs.</p>

<p>The Egyptian carpets were not made of the
same material and weave as are the so-called
Oriental rugs of to-day. The pile surface was
not made by tying small tufts of wool upon the
warp thread. The Chinese seem to have been the
first to have made rugs in this way. Persia
acquired the art from Babylon many centuries
before Christ, since which time she has held the
foremost place as a rug weaving nation.</p>

<p>There is no more fascinating study than that
of Oriental rugs and there are few hobbies that
claim so absorbing a devotion. To the connoisseur
it proves a veritable enchantment: to the
busy man a mental salvation. He reads from his
rugs the life history of both a bygone and a living
people. A fine rug ranks second to no other creation
as a work of art and although many of them
are made by semi-barbaric people, they possess
rare artistic beauty of design and execution to
which the master hand of Time puts the finishing
touches. Each masterpiece has its individuality,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg. 19]</a></span>
no two being alike, although each may be true in
general to the family patterns, and therein consists
their enchantment. The longer you study
them the more they fascinate. Is it strange then
that this wonderful reproduction of colors appeals
to connoisseurs and art lovers of every country?</p>

<p>Were some of the antique or even the modern
pieces endowed with the gift of speech what wonderfully
interesting stories they could tell and yet
to the connoisseur the history, so to speak, of
many of these gems of the Eastern loom is
plainly legible in their weave, designs and colors.
The family or tribal legends worked out in the
patterns, the religious or ethical meaning of the
blended colors, the death of a weaver before the
completion of his work, which is afterwards taken
up by another, the toil and privation of which
every rug is witness, are all matters of interest
only to the student.</p>

<p>Americans have been far behind Europeans in
recognizing the artistic worth and the many other
advantages of the Oriental rug over any other
kind. Twenty-five years ago few American homes
possessed even one. Since then a marked change
in public taste has taken place. All classes have
become interested and, according to their resources,
have purchased them in a manner characteristic
of the American people, so that now
some of the choicest gems in existence have found
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg. 20]</a></span>
a home in the United States. To what extent this
is true may be shown by the custom house
statistics, which prove that, even under a tariff
of nearly 50 per cent., the annual importation exceeds
over five million dollars and New York City
with the possible exception of London has become
the largest rug market of the world. This importation
will continue on even a larger scale until
the Orient is robbed of all its fabrics and the Persian
rug will have become a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Already the western demand has been so great
that the dyes, materials and quality of workmanship
have greatly deteriorated and the Orientals
are even importing machine made rugs from
Europe for their own use. It therefore behooves
us to cherish the Oriental rugs now in our possession.</p>

<p>Both Europe and the United States are manufacturing
artistic carpets of a high degree of excellence,
but they never have and never will be
able to produce any that will compare with those
made in the East. They may copy the designs
and match the shades, to a certain extent, but they
lack the inspiration and the knack of blending,
both of which are combined in the Oriental
product.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Only in a land where time is of little value and
is not considered as an equivalent to money, can
such artistic perfection be brought about.</p>

      making four hundred and forty-eight knots to the square inch,
      tied so closely that it is quite difficult to separate the pile sufficiently
      to see the wool or warp threads. The central field consists of the

Oriental Rugs</span></h2>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2>COST AND TARIFF</h2>


<p>The value of an Oriental rug cannot be gauged
by measurement any more than can that of a fine
painting; it depends upon the number of knots to
the square inch, the fineness of the material, the
richness and stability of its colors, the amount of
detail in design, its durability and, last but not
least, its age. None of these qualifications being at
sight apparent to the novice, he is unable to make
a fair comparison of prices, as frequently rugs
which appear to him to be quite alike and equally
valuable may be far apart in actual worth.</p>

<p>When we consider that from the time a rug
leaves the weavers' hands until it reaches the
final buyer there are at least from five to seven
profits to pay besides the government tariffs
thereon, it is no wonder that the prices at times
seem exorbitant. The transportation charges
amount to about ten cents per square foot.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg. 26]</a></span>
The Turkish government levies one per cent.
export duty and the heavily protected United
States levies forty per cent. ad valorem and ten
cents per square foot besides, all of which alone
adds over fifty per cent. to the original cost in
America, and yet should we estimate the work
upon Oriental rugs by the American standard of
wages they would cost from ten to fifty times their
present prices.</p>

<p>To furnish a home with Oriental rugs is not
as expensive as it would at first seem. They can
be bought piece by piece at intervals, as circumstances
warrant, and when a room is once provided
for it is for all time, whereas the carpet
account is one that is never closed.</p>

<p class="pmb2">In the United States good, durable Eastern
rugs may be bought for from sixty cents to ten
dollars per square foot, and in England for much
less. Extremely choice pieces may run up to the
thousands. At the Marquand sale in New York
City in 1902, a fifteenth century Persian rug
(10-10 x 6-1) was sold for $36,000, nearly $550 a
square foot. The holy carpet of the Mosque at
Ardebil, woven at Kashan in 1536 and now owned
by the South Kensington Museum, of London, is
valued at $30,000. The famous hunting rug,
which was presented some years ago by the late
Ex-Governor Ames of Massachusetts to the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts, is said to have cost $35,000.
The late Mr. Yerkes of New York City paid
$60,000 for his "Holy Carpet," the highest price
ever paid for a rug. Mr. J. P. Morgan recently
paid $17,000 for one 20 x 15. Two years ago
H. C. Frick paid $160,000 for eight small Persians,
$20,000 apiece. Senator Clark's collection cost
$3,000,000, H. O. Havemeyer's $250,000, and O.
H. Payne's $200,000.</p>

<p>Everything considered, the difference in cost
per square foot between the average Oriental and
the home product amounts to little in comparison
to the difference in endurance. If one uses the
proper judgment in selecting, his money is much
better spent when invested in the former than
when invested in the latter. While the nap of
the domestic is worn down to the warp the
Oriental has been improving in color and sheen as
well as in value. This is due to the fact that the
Eastern product is made of the softest of wool
and treated with dyes which have stood the test
of centuries and which preserve the wool instead
of destroying it as do the aniline dyes.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In comparing the cost of furnishing a home
with Oriental rugs or with carpets one should
further take into consideration the fact that with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg. 28]</a></span>
carpets much unnecessary floor space must be
covered which represents so much waste money.
Also the question of health involved in the use of
carpets is a very serious one. They retain dust
and germs of all kinds and are taken up and
cleaned, as a rule, but once a year. With rugs
the room is much more easily kept clean and the
furniture does not have to be moved whenever
sweeping time comes around.</p>

<h2>DEALERS AND AUCTIONS</h2>


<p>Few Europeans or Americans penetrate to the
interior markets of the East where home-made
rugs find their first sale. Agents of some of the
large importers have been sent over to collect
rugs from families or small factories and the
tales of Oriental shrewdness and trickery which
they bring back are many and varied. We have
in this country many honest, reliable foreign
dealers, but occasionally one meets with one of
the class above referred to. In dealing with such
people it is safe never to bid more than half and
never to give over two-thirds of the price they ask
you. Also never show special preference for any
particular piece, otherwise you will be charged
more for it. No dealer or authority may lay claim
to infallibility, but few of these people have any
adequate knowledge of their stock and are, as a
rule, uncertain authorities, excepting in those
fabrics which come from the vicinity of the
province in which they lived. They buy their stock
in large quantities, usually by the bale at so much
a square foot, and then mark each according to
their judgment so as to make the bale average up
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg. 32]</a></span>
well and pay a good profit. So it is that an expert
may occasionally select a choice piece at a bargain
while the novice usually pays more than the actual
worth. Every rug has three values, first the art
value depending upon its colors and designs,
second the collector's value depending upon its
rarity, and third the utility value depending upon
its durability. No dealer can buy rugs on utility
value alone and he who sells Oriental rugs very
cheap usually sells very cheap rugs.</p>

<p class="pmb2">It might be well right here to state that when
rugs are sold by the bale the wholesaler usually
places a few good ones in the bale for the purpose
of disposing of the poor ones. Dealers can always
find an eager market for good rugs, but poor ones
often go begging, and in order to dispose of them
the auction is resorted to. They are put up under
a bright reflected light which shows them off to
the best advantage; the bidder is allowed no
opportunity for a thorough examination and
almost invariably there are present several fake
bidders. This you can prove to your own satisfaction
by attending some auction several days
in succession and you will see the same beautiful
Tabriz bid off each time at a ridiculously low
price, while those that you actually see placed into
the hands of the deliveryman will average in price
about the same as similar rugs at a retail store.</p>

<h2 id="ANTIQUES">ANTIQUES</h2>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg. 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The passion for antiques in this country has in
the past been so strong that rugs showing signs
of hard wear, with ragged edges and plenty of
holes, were quite as salable as those which were
perfect in every respect and the amateur collector
of so-called "antiques" was usually an easy
victim. Of late, however, the antique craze seems
to be dying out and the average buyer of to-day
will select a perfect modern fabric in preference
to an imperfect antique one.</p>

<p>There is no question that age is an important
factor in the beauty of a rug and that an antique
in a state of good preservation is much more
valuable than a modern fabric, especially to the
collector, to whom the latter has little value. In
order to be classed as an antique a rug should be
at least fifty years old, having been made before
the introduction of aniline dyes. An expert can
determine the age by the method of weaving, the
material used, the color combination, and the
design, with more certainty than can the art connoisseur
tell the age of certain European pictures,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg. 36]</a></span>
to which he assigns dates by their peculiarities in
style. Every time a design is copied it undergoes
some slight change until, perhaps, the original
design is lost. This modification of designs also
affords great assistance in determining their age.
In the Tiffany studios in New York City can be
seen a series of Feraghan rugs showing the
change in design for several generations.</p>

<p>As a rule more knowledge concerning the age
of a rug can be obtained from the colors and the
materials employed than from the designs. An
antique appears light and glossy when the nap
runs from you, whereas it will appear dark and
rich but without lustre when viewed from the
other end. Such rugs are usually more or less
shiny on the back and their edges are either
somewhat ragged or have been overcast anew.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few rare old pieces
which may be found in the palaces of rulers and
certain noblemen, the Orient has been pretty well
stripped of its antiques. Mr. Charles Quill Jones,
who has made three trips through the Orient in
search of old rugs, reports that region nearly bare
of gems. During his last sojourn in those parts
he has succeeded in collecting a considerable
number of valuable pieces, but his success may be
attributed to the poverty and disruption of households
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg. 37]</a></span>
occasioned by the losses of the recent revolution
in Persia. As especially rare he writes of
having secured five pieces which were made during
the reign of Shah Abbas in the 16th century.
In England, France, Germany, Russia, Austria,
Poland, and especially Bavaria, there are many
fine old pieces, those of London, Paris, Berlin,
Vienna, and Budapest being particularly noteworthy.
The Rothschild collection in Paris contains
many matchless pieces and the Ardebil
Mosque carpet, which is in the South Kensington
Museum, London, is without doubt the most
famous piece of weaving in the world. According
to the inscription upon it, it was woven by
Maksoud, the slave of the Holy Place of Kashan,
in 1536. It measures thirty-four feet by seventeen
feet six inches and contains 32,000,000 knots. No
doubt there are more good genuine antiques in
Europe and America than in the entire Orient.
They are to be found, as a rule, in museums and
in private collections. A number of really old and
very valuable pieces may be seen at the Metropolitan
Museum of Fine Arts in New York City.
The Yerkes collection of Oriental rugs, which has
recently been disposed of at public sale by the
American Art Galleries, contained nothing but
Polish fabrics and Persian carpets of royal origin,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg. 38]</a></span>
made at some early date prior to the seventeenth
century. Some of the most prominent collectors
of the United States are Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan
of New York City, who has one of the most valuable
collections in the world; Mr. H. C. Frick of
Pittsburg, Pa., Miss A. L. Pease of Hartford,
Conn., Mr. C. F. Williams of Morristown, Pa.,
the Hon. W. A. Clark and Mr. Benjamin Altman
of New York City, Mr. Theodore M. Davis of
Newport, R. I., Mr. Frank Loftus, Mr. F. A.
Turner and Mr. L. A. Shortell of Boston; Mr. J. F.
Ballard of St. Louis and Mr. P. A. B. Widener of
Elkins Park, Pa. The late Ex-Governor Ames
of Massachusetts was an enthusiastic collector
and possessed many fine pieces.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The late A. T. Sinclair of Allston, Mass.,
possessed over one hundred and fifty antiques,
which he himself collected over twenty years ago
from the various districts of Persia, Asia Minor,
the Caucasus, Turkestan, and Beluchistan. Many
of these pieces are from one hundred and fifty to
two hundred and fifty years old and every one is
a gem.</p>

<p>With the exception of an occasional old
Ghiordes, Kulah, Bergama or Mosul, for which
are asked fabulous prices, few antiques can now
be found for sale. It is on account of the enormous
prices which antiques bring that faked
antiques have found their way into the market.
Rugs may be artificially aged but never without
detriment to them. The aging process is mostly
done by cunning adepts in Persia or Constantinople
before they are exported, although in recent
years the doctoring process has been practised to
quite an extent in the United States, and a large
portion of the undoctored rugs which reach these
shores are soon afterwards put through this
process. The majority of dealers will tell you
that there is comparatively little sale for the
undoctored pieces. The chemically subdued tones
and artificial sheen appeal to most people who
know little about Oriental rugs.</p>

<p>For toning down the bright colors they use
chloride of lime, oxalic acid or lemon juice; for
giving them an old appearance they use coffee
grounds, and for the creation of an artificial sheen
or lustre the rugs are usually run between hot rollers
after the application of glycerine or paraffin
wax; they are sometimes buried in the ground for
a time, and water color paints are frequently used
to restore the color in spots where the acid has
acted too vigorously. Such rugs usually show a
slight tinge of pink in the white.</p>

<p>There is a class of modern rugs of good quality,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg. 40]</a></span>
good material, and vegetable dyed, but with colors
too bright for Occidental taste. Such rugs are
sometimes treated with water, acid, and alkali.
The effect of the acid is here neutralized by the
alkali in such a way that the colors are rendered
more subdued and mellow in tone without resulting
injury to the material.</p>

<p class="pmb2">What the trade speaks of as a "washed" rug
is not necessarily a "doctored" one. There is a
legitimate form of washing which is really a finishing
process and which does not injure the
fabric. It merely washes out the surplus color
and sets the rest. The belief that only aniline
dyes will rub off when wet and that vegetable ones
will not do so is erroneous. If a rug is new and
never has been washed the case is quite the opposite.
For the reader's own satisfaction, let him
moisten and rub a piece of domestic carpet. He
will find that the aniline of the latter fabric is
comparatively fast, whereas, in a newly made
vegetable dyed Oriental, certain colors, especially
the blues, reds and greens, will wipe off to a
certain extent. After this first washing out,
however, nothing other than a chemical will disturb
the vegetable color.</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO BUYERS</h2>


<p>No set of rules can be furnished which will
fully protect purchasers against deception. It is
well, however, for one, before purchasing, to
acquire some knowledge of the characteristics of
the most common varieties as well as of the
different means employed in examining them.</p>

<p>In the first place, avoid dealers who fail to
mark their goods in plain figures. Be on the safe
side and go to a reliable house with an established
reputation. They will not ask you fancy prices. If
it is in a department store be sure you deal with
some one who is regularly connected with the
Oriental rug department. You would never dream
of buying a piano of one who knows nothing of
music. So many domestic rugs copy Oriental patterns
that many uninformed people cannot tell the
difference. The following are some of the characteristics
of the Eastern fabrics which are not possessed
by the Western ones. First, they show
their whole pattern and color in detail on the back
side; second, the pile is composed of rows of
distinctly tied knots, which are made plainly
visible by separating it; third, the sides are either
overcast with colored wool or have a narrow
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg. 44]</a></span>
selvage; and fourth, the ends have either a selvage
or fringe or both.</p>

<p>In buying, first select what pleases you in size,
color, and design, then take time and go over it as
thoroughly as a horseman would over a horse
which he contemplates buying. Lift it to test the
weight. Oriental rugs are much heavier in proportion
to their size than are the domestics. See
if it lies straight and flat on the floor and has no
folds. Crookedness detracts much from its value.
Take hold of the centre and pull it up into a sort
of cone shape. If compactly woven it will stand
alone just as a piece of good silk will. Examine
the pile and see whether it is long, short or worn
in places down to the warp threads; whether it
lies down as in loosely woven rugs or stands up
nearly straight as in closely woven rugs; also
note the number of knots to the square inch and
whether or not they are firmly tied. The wearing
qualities depend upon the length of the pile and
the compactness of weaving. Separate the pile,
noting whether the wool is of the same color but
of a deeper shade near the knot than it is on the
surface or if it is of an entirely different color.
Vegetable dyes usually fade to lighter shades of
the original color, while anilines fade to different
colors, one or another of the dyes used in combination
entirely disappearing at times and others
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg. 45]</a></span>
remaining. This will also be noticeable, to a
certain extent, when one end of the fabric is
turned over and the two sides are compared.
Two rugs may be almost exactly alike in every
respect excepting the dye, the one being worth
ten to fifteen times as much as the other.</p>

<p>A good way to test the material is to slightly
burn its surface with a match, thus producing a
black spot. If the wool is good the singed part
can be brushed off without leaving the slightest
trace of the burn. The smell of the burnt wool
will also easily be recognized. Ascertain the
relative strength of the material, making sure
that the warp is the heaviest and strongest, the
pile next and the woof the lightest. If the warp
is lighter than the pile it will break easily or if
the warp is light and the weaving loose it will
pucker. Rugs whose foundation threads are dry
and rotten from age are worthless. In such pieces
the woof threads, which are the lightest, will break
in seams along the line of the warp when slightly
twisted.</p>

<p>Examine the selvage. It will often indicate
the method of its manufacture, showing whether
it is closely or loosely woven, for the selvage is a
continuation of the groundwork of the rug itself.
Also notice the material, whether of hair, wool or
cotton. Separate the pile and examine the woof,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg. 46]</a></span>
noting the number of threads between each row
of knots. If possible pull one of them out. In
the cheaper grade of rugs you will often find two
strands of cotton and one of wool twisted together.
Such rugs are very likely some time to bunch up,
especially if washed. See if the selvage or warp
threads on the sides are broken in places. If so
it would be an unwise choice. Now turn the rug
over and view it from the back, noting whether
repairs have been made and, if so, to what extent.
View it from the back with the light shining into
the pile to see if there are any moths. Pat it and
knock out the dust. In some instances you will
be surprised how thoroughly impregnated it will
be with the dust of many lands and how much
more attractive the colors are after such a patting.
Rub your hand over the surface with the
nap. If the wool is of a fine quality a feeling of
electric smoothness will result, such as is experienced
when stroking the back of a cat in cold
weather.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Finally, before coming to a decision regarding
its purchase, have it sent to your home for a few
days. There you can study it more leisurely and
may get an idea as to whether or not you would
soon tire of the designs or colors. While you have
it there do not forget to take soap, water and a
stiff brush and scrub well some portion of it,
selecting a part where some bright color such as
green, blue or red joins a white. After the rug
has thoroughly dried notice whether or not the
white has taken any of the other colors. If so,
they are aniline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg. 47]</a></span></p>

<p>A rather vulgar but very good way of telling
whether a rug is doctored or not is to wet it with
saliva and rub it in well. If chemically treated it
will have a peculiar, disagreeable, pungent odor.</p>

<p>A fairly accurate way of determining the claim
of the fabric to great age is to draw out a woof
thread and notice how difficult it is to straighten it,
even after days of soaking in water. Unless one is
an expert, he should refrain from relying upon his
own judgment in buying a rug for an antique.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to know the meaning
of the tags and seals so frequently found on rugs.
The little square or nearly square cloth tag that is
so frequently attached at one corner to the under
surface by two wire clasps has on it the number
given to that particular piece for the convenience
of the washer, the exporter, the importer and the
custom officials. The rug is recorded by its
number instead of by its name to avoid confusion
and to save labor. The round lead seal
which is frequently attached to one corner of the
rug by a flexible wire or a string, especially among
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg. 48]</a></span>
the larger pieces, is the importer's seal, on one
side of which will be found his initials. These
also are of great assistance to the custom officials.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Before closing this chapter a few words in
regard to the selection of rugs for certain rooms
might be acceptable, though this is, to a large
extent, a matter of individual taste; yet in making
a selection one should have some consideration
for the decorations and furniture of the room in
which the rugs are to be laid and they should
harmonize with the side walls, whether the harmony
be one of analogy or of contrast. The floor
of a room is the base upon which the scheme of
decoration is to be built. Its covering should
carry the strongest tones. If a single tint is to
be used the walls must take the next gradation
and the ceiling the last. These gradations must
be far enough removed from each other in depth
of tone to be quite apparent but not to lose their
relation. Contrasting colors do not always harmonize.
A safe rule to follow would be to select
a color with any of its complementary colors.
For instance, the primary colors are red, blue, and
yellow. The complementary color of red would
be the color formed by the combination of the
other two, which in this case would be green
composed of yellow and blue; therefore red
and green would form a harmony of contrast.
Likewise red and blue make violet, which would
harmonize with yellow; red and yellow make
orange, which would harmonize with blue, etc.</p>

<p>Light rooms of Louis XVI style would hardly
look as well with bright, rich colored rugs as they
would with delicately tinted Kirmans, Saruks,
and Sennas. Nor would the latter styles look as
well in a Dutch dining room, finished in black oak,
as would the rich, dark Bokharas and Feraghans.
Mission rooms also require the dark colored rugs.
If the room is pleasing in its proportion and one
rug is used it should conform as nearly in proportion
as possible. If the room is too long for its
width select a rug which will more nearly cover
the floor in width than it will in length. A rug
used in the centre of a room with considerable
floor area around it decreases the apparent size of
the room. Long rugs placed lengthwise of a room
increase its apparent length, while short rugs
placed across a room decrease its apparent length,
and rugs with large patterns, like wall paper with
large patterns, will dwarf the whole apartment.
The following ideas are merely offered as suggestions
without any pretension whatever to superiority
of judgment.</p>

<p>For a <span class="smcap">Vestibule</span> a long-naped mat, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg. 50]</a></span>
corresponds in shape to the vestibule and covers
fully one-half of its surface, such for instance as
a Beluchistan or a Mosul. Appropriate shorter
naped pieces may be found among the Anatolians,
Meles, Ladiks or Yuruks. As a rule the dark
colored ones are preferable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hall.</span>&mdash;If the hall is a long, narrow one, use
long runners which cover fully two-thirds of its
surface. Such may be found among the Mosuls,
Sarabands, Hamadans, Ispahans, Shirvans, and
Genghis.</p>

<p>For a reception hall a Khiva Bokhara, a
Yomud, a dark colored Mahal, or several Kazaks
or Karabaghs would look well if the woodwork is
dark. If the woodwork is light several light colored
Caucasian or Persian pieces such as the
Daghestans, Kabistans, Sarabands, Hamadans,
or Shiraz would be appropriate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reception Room.</span>&mdash;A light colored Kermanshah,
Tabriz, Saruk, Senna, or Khorasan. Usually
one large piece which covers from two-thirds
to three-fourths of the floor surface is the most
desirable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Living Room.</span>&mdash;For this room, which is the
most used of any in the home, we should have
the most durable rugs and as a rule a number of
small or medium sized pieces, which can be easily
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg. 51]</a></span>
shifted from one position to another, are preferable.
Here, too, respect must be had for harmony
with the side walls, woodwork and furniture, as
it is here that the family spend most of their
time and decorative discord would hardly add to
one's personal enjoyment. Many appropriate
selections may be made from the Feraghans,
Ispahans, Sarabands, Shiraz, Mosuls, Daghestans,
Kabistans, and Beluchistans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dining Room.</span>&mdash;Ordinarily nothing would be
more appropriate than one of the Herez or Sultanabad
productions unless the room be one of
the Mission style, in which case a Khiva Bokhara
would be most desirable. Small pieces would not
be suitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Library or Den.</span>&mdash;One large or several small
pieces, usually the dark rich shades are preferable,
such for instance as are found in the Khivas,
Yomuds, Kurdistans, Feraghans, Shiraz, Kazaks,
Beluchistans or Tekke Bokharas, the predominating
color selected according to the decorations
of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bath Room.</span>&mdash;One heavy long-piled, soft piece
such as are some of the Bijars or Mosuls in light
colors.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Bedrooms.</span>&mdash;For chambers where colors rather
than period styles are dominant and where large
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg. 52]</a></span>
rugs are never appropriate, prayer rugs like those
of the Kulah, Ghiordes, Ladik, Anatolian, or
Daghestan varieties are to be desired. Those
with yellow as the predominating color blend
especially well with mahogany furniture if the
walls are in buff or yellow tones. The Nomad
products are especially desirable for bedrooms
on account of the comfort which they afford.
Being thick and soft the sensation to the tread is
luxurious. An occasional Anatolian, Ladik, Bergama,
Meles, or Bokhara mat placed before a
dresser or a wash-stand; a Shiraz pillow on the
sofa; a Senna Ghileem thrown over a divan; a
Shiraz, Mosul, or Beluchistan saddle-bag on a
Mission standard as a receptacle for magazines;
a silk rug as a table spread, etc., will all add
greatly to the Oriental effect.</p>

<h2>THE HYGIENE OF THE RUG</h2>


<p>In all the literature on Oriental Rugs no mention
has been made of their sanitary condition
when laid on the floors of our homes. In response
to a letter of inquiry, one of our American missionaries,
a young lady stationed at Sivas, Turkey
in Asia, who very modestly objects to the use of
her name, so well explained the condition of
affairs that portions of her letter given verbatim
will prove most interesting. She says:</p>

<p>"In Sivas there are a number of rug factories
in which are employed many thousand little girls,
ages ranging from four years upward. They
work from twelve to fourteen hours a day and I
believe the largest amount received by them is
five piasters (less than twenty cents) and the small
girls receive ten to twenty paras (a cent or two).
These factories are hotbeds of tuberculosis and
we have many of these cases in our Mission Hospital.
Of course this amount of money scarcely
keeps them in bread and in this underfed condition,
working so long in ill ventilated rooms, they
quickly succumb to this disease. These girls are
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg. 56]</a></span>
all Armenians in that region. The Turks do not
allow their women and children to work in public
places. The Armenians are going to reap a sad
harvest in the future in thus allowing the future
wives and mothers of their race to undermine
their health working in these factories. These
rugs are all exported to Europe and America.</p>

<p>"No matter what part of the city you pass
through this time of the year you will see looms
up in the different homes and most of the family,
especially the women and children, working on
these rugs, and it is very interesting to watch
them and to see how skilful even the small children
grow in weaving these intricate patterns.
Making rugs in the homes is quite different from
making them in the factories, for in the summer at
least they have plenty of fresh air.</p>

<p>"No doubt many rugs made in these homes
are filled with germs of contagious diseases, for
they use no precautions here when they have such
diseases in the family, and usually the poor people
only have one room, and if a member of the family
is stricken with smallpox or scarlet fever the rest
of the family continue to work on the rug often
in the same room."</p>

<p>Another correspondent from Marash, Turkey
in Asia, says, "If you are interested in humanity
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg. 57]</a></span>
as well as in rugs, please put in a strong plea
against some of these factories which are employing
children who can scarcely speak. These little
babies sit from morning till evening tying and
cutting knots in damp and poorly ventilated
places. Is it a wonder that diseases, especially
tuberculosis, are developing rapidly among
them?"</p>

<p>A third correspondent says, "Often rugs upon
which patients have died from contagious diseases
are sold without cleaning. In fact, they are
rarely cleaned."</p>

<p>Upon receipt of the above a letter of inquiry
was at once sent to the Treasury Department at
Washington regarding the disinfection of textiles
from the Orient immediately upon their arrival
into this country, to which we were informed that
"The Surgeon-General of the Public Health and
Marine Hospital Service stated that such rugs,
if originating in parts or places infected with
quarantinable diseases, would be required to be
disinfected under the quarantine laws." This
sounds sensible, but when the rugs are sent from
all parts of the Orient to Constantinople, from
whence they are shipped in bales to the United
States, pray how can the Surgeon-General discriminate?
The only safe way is for the government
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg. 58]</a></span>
to have strict laws regarding their immediate
and thorough disinfection. We already
have a law which requires the disinfection of
hides before they are shipped to this country. It
reads: "Officers of the customs are directed to
treat hides of neat cattle shipped to the United
States without proper disinfection as prohibited
importations, and to refuse entry of such hides."
Also, "the disinfection of such hides in this country
or storage of the same in general order warehouses
will not be permitted, for the reason that
the passage of diseased hides through the country
or their storage with other goods will tend to the
dissemination of cattle disease in the United
States." (See Section 12 of the Tariff Act of
August 5, 1909.)</p>

<p>Ex-President Taft once recommended a new
department of public health whose duty it would
be to consider all matters relating to the health of
the nation. If his suggestions are carried out no
doubt the question of disinfecting Oriental imports
will be satisfactorily disposed of.</p>

<p>Until then we should see to it that all Oriental
rugs are at least clean and free from dust before
allowing them to be delivered in our homes. The
great majority of these rugs, when leaving the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg. 59]</a></span>
Orient, are impregnated with dust from their
adobe floors and, if free of this dust, they have in
all probability been pretty thoroughly cleaned by
some reliable importer or dealer, the majority of
whom are beginning to realize the importance of
this procedure.</p>

<h2>THE CARE OF RUGS</h2>


<p>There is a popular idea that an Oriental rug
will never wear out and that the harder it is used
the more silky it will grow. This is an erroneous
idea and many rugs that would be almost priceless
now are beyond repair, having fallen into the
hands of people who did not appreciate them and
give them the proper care. Oriental rugs cannot
be handled and beaten like the domestics without
serious injury. In the Orient they receive much
better treatment than they do at our hands.
There they are never exposed to the glare of a
strong light and are never subjected to the contact
of anything rougher than the bare feet. The
peculiar silkiness of the nap so much admired in
old pieces is due to the fact that the Oriental
never treads on them with his shoes.</p>

<p>Large rugs, having a longer pile, resist more
the wear and tear from the shoes, but they must
be handled with greater care than the small ones,
as, being heavier, the warp or woof threads are
more liable to break.</p>

<p>As a rule rugs should be cleaned every week
or two. Never shake them or hang them on a line,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg. 64]</a></span>
as the foundation threads may break, letting the
knots slip and spread apart. There are more rugs
worn out in this way than by actual service. Lay
them face downward on the grass or on a clean
floor and gently beat them with something pliable
like a piece of rubber hose cut in strips. With a
clean broom sweep the back, then turning them
over, sweep across the nap each way, then with
the nap. Brushing against the nap is most harmful,
as it may loosen the knots and force the dust
and dirt into the texture. Finally dampen the
broom or, better still, dampen a clean white cloth
in water to which a little alcohol has been added,
and wipe over the entire rug in the direction in
which the nap lies. The sweeping process keeps
the end of the pile clean and bright and gives it
a silky, lustrous appearance. Sometimes clean,
dampened sawdust can be used and, in the winter
time, nothing is better than snow, which will clean
and brighten them wonderfully.</p>

<p>Many rugs are improved by an occasional
washing. It is usually advisable to have some
reliable man, who understands this work, to do it
for you, as it is quite a task and few homes have a
suitable place for it. A good concrete floor will
answer nicely. With a stiff brush, a cake of
castile or wool soap and some warm water give
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg. 65]</a></span>
the pile a thorough scrubbing in every direction
excepting against the nap. Rinse with warm
water, then with cold, turning the hose upon it for
fifteen or twenty minutes. Soft water is preferable
if it can be obtained. Finally, with a smooth stick
or a wooden roller, squeeze the water out by stroking
it in the direction of the nap. This stroking
process should be continued for some time, after
which the rug is spread out on a roof face upward
for several clear days.</p>

<p>Unless rugs are frequently moved or cleaned
moths are sure to get into them. Sweeping alone
is not always sufficient to keep them out. For this
purpose the compressed air method is <i>par
excellence</i>.</p>

<p>If you expect to close your home for several
weeks or months do not leave your rugs on the
floor. After having all necessary repairs made,
have them thoroughly cleaned by the compressed
air process, then place them in canvas or strong
paper bags, sealing them tightly. A large rug
may be wrapped with clean white paper, then
with tar paper. It is better to roll than to fold
them, but if folded always see that the pile is on
the inside, else bad creases may be made in them
which may never come out. They should be stored
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg. 66]</a></span>
in a dry, airy room, as they readily absorb
moisture.</p>

<p>When a rug shows a tendency to curl on the
corners only, a very good idea is to weight it
down with tea lead which is folded in such a way
as to make a piece about four inches long, one
inch wide and one-eighth of an inch thick. This
is inclosed in a cloth pocket which is sewed to
the under side of the rug at the corners so that
its length lies in the direction of the warp.</p>

<p>Many rugs that are crooked may easily be
straightened by tacking them face downward in
the proper shape and wetting them. They should
be kept in that position until thoroughly dried and
shrunken to the proper shape. Obstinate and
conspicuous stains may be removed by clipping
the discolored pile down flat to the warp, carefully
pulling out the knots from the back of the rug and
having new ones inserted. This, however, with all
other extensive repairs, should be done by one
especially skilled in that line.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Considering the rapid increase in the price of
good Oriental rugs within the past few years we
should appreciate and care for all the fine examples
which we already have in our possession.</p>

<h2>THE MATERIAL OF RUGS</h2>


<p>The materials from which rugs are made,
named in order of the ratio in which they are used,
are wool, goats' hair, camels' hair, cotton, silk,
and hemp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wool.</span>&mdash;The wool produced in the colder provinces
is softer and better than that produced in
the warmer provinces. Likewise that produced
at a high altitude is superior to that from a lower
altitude. The quality of the pasturage plays a
most important part in the quality of the wool.
For this reason no better wool is to be found
anywhere in the world than from the provinces
of Khorasan and Kurdistan. Very often the
sheep are covered over with a sheet to protect and
keep the wool in a clean, lustrous condition. The
quality of the wool also depends to no small extent
upon the age of the sheep from which it is
taken, that from the young lambs being softer and
more pliable than that from the older animals.
The softest and most lustrous wool is that which
is obtained by combing the sheep in winter and is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg. 70]</a></span>
known as kurk. From this some of the choicest
prayer rugs are made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goats' Hair.</span>&mdash;From the goats of some localities,
especially in Asia Minor and Turkestan, is
obtained a soft down which is used to a large
extent in the manufacture of rugs. The straight
hair of the goat is also used. It is of a light brown
color and, as it will not dye well, is sometimes
used without dyeing to produce brown grounds, as
in some of the Kurdistan products. It is quite
commonly used as a selvage and fringe in the
Turkoman products. When wet it curls so tightly
that it is difficult to spin it, therefore it is not
always washed. This accounts for the strong
odor which is especially noticeable in warm
weather.</p>

<p>Mohair is obtained from the Angora goat of
Asia Minor, while cashmere consists of the soft
under-wool of the Cashmere goat of Tibet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camels' Hair.</span>&mdash;In Eastern Persia, Afghanistan,
and Beluchistan are camels which produce a
long woolly hair suitable for rug weaving which
is never dyed, is silky and soft, has phenomenal
durability and is used quite freely in the Hamadan,
Mosul, and Beluchistan products. It is more
expensive than sheep's wool but has one great
drawback in that on the muggy days of summer it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg. 71]</a></span>
has a disagreeable odor. Most of the alleged
camels' hair of commerce is a goats' hair pure
and simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotton.</span>&mdash;The majority of the finer Persian
rugs have cotton warp and woof. It makes a much
lighter, better and more compact foundation on
which to tie the pile, and a rug with such a foundation
will hold its shape much better. Seldom
is cotton used for the pile excepting once in a
great while a Bokhara may be found with small
portions of the white worked in cotton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silk.</span>&mdash;In the regions bordering on the Caspian
Sea and in some parts of China where silk
is plentiful it is used to quite an extent in the
making of rugs, not only for the nap but frequently
for the warp and woof as well. It makes
a beautiful fabric, but of course will not wear like
wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hemp.</span>&mdash;Hemp is seldom used in rug making
for the reason that it rots quickly after being wet
and the entire fabric is soon gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation of the Wool.</span>&mdash;After being
sorted, the wool is taken to a brook and washed
thoroughly at intervals in the cold running water
for several times until all foreign matters are
removed, leaving the animal fat which gives it
the soft, silky appearance. The results of washing
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg. 72]</a></span>
depend to a certain extent upon the quality of
the water used in the process, soft water giving
much better results than does the hard.</p>

<p>After a thorough bleaching in the sun's rays
it is placed in a stone vessel, covered with a mixture
of flour and starch, then pounded with
wooden mallets, after which it is again washed
in running water for several hours and again
dried in the sun. Under this process it shrinks in
weight from forty to fifty per cent., and after
being spun the yarn is sold everywhere for the
same price as twice the amount of the raw
material.</p>

<p>It is spun in three different ways. That which
is intended for the warp is spun tightly and of
medium thickness, that for the woof rather fine,
and that for the pile heavy and loose.</p>

<p class="pmb2">There are so many different natural shades
of wool that much of it can be utilized in its
natural color. The dyeing is always done in the
yarn, never in the loose fibres, and will be explained
in the chapter under Dyes.</p>

      splendid coloring, are well represented by this specimen. The very

    <p class="left"><span class="small">In and above the "Mihrab" or niche will be noted the "Ubrech"
      or pitcher, a most interesting design. It is from this "Ubrech" that
      water is poured upon the hands of the Mohammedan as he makes
      his ablutions. Wash basins are unknown in the Orient and no
      follower of Mohammed will consent to wash in anything except
      running water.</span></p>

    <p class="left"><span class="small">So the "Ubrech" is almost as important as the prayer rug itself,

<h2>DYES AND DYERS</h2>


<p>The secrets of the Eastern dye-pot are responsible
for the unrivalled beauty and durability of
the Oriental rug. These secrets of extracting
coloring matter from roots, leaves, flowers, barks,
and various other vegetable and animal products
by a process of boiling, fermenting, etc., were
guarded religiously and descended from father to
son, many of them having been lost as the family
became extinct. Each dyer or family of dyers
has some peculiar and secret method of producing
certain shades.</p>

<p>Our great knowledge of chemistry has aided
us little in our effort to duplicate and produce
certain colors which the Orientals produced with
the simplest ingredients and without any knowledge
of chemistry whatever. Every kind of plant
from which dyestuff is obtained is a product of
geographic environment, the quality of which
depends upon certain conditions of climate and
soil. For this reason those of one locality may be
superior to those of another. On the other hand
it must not be forgotten that there are many
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg. 76]</a></span>
classes of vegetable dyes which are not scientifically
or honestly made.</p>

<p>After the wool has gone through the washing
process and dried it is dipped into one or more
pots, according to the shade desired, for a certain
length of time, when, without being wrung out,
it is hung up over the dye-pot to drip and after
being washed once more in cold water it finally
is spread out in the sun. Even when the same
process is followed each time it is seldom that two
bunches of material dyed have exactly the same
shade, as the density of the dye and its shade
differs somewhat with each dip of wool from a
previous pot. This probably accounts in part for
the innumerable shadings seen in the rugs of certain
localities. Formerly the dyers employed as
mordants, valonia, pomegranate rind, sumac, and
the barks of certain trees, but in some districts
of late they use alum. This, with the lime solution
in which the wool is washed before dyeing to increase
the brilliancy of the dyes, makes the yarn
brittle and lessens its wearing quality. Most vegetable
dyes fade, but they fade into softer and more
pleasing shades. The best colors for service are,
as a rule, the blues, yellows, and reds, all of which
improve greatly with age. The browns are apt to
lose their lustre, while the blacks, which are really
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg. 77]</a></span>
mineral, being made by the action of vinegar on
iron shavings, seem most corrosive and gradually
eat the wool. Many of the antiques you will find
in a splendid state of preservation with the exception
of the black, which has eaten the pile down to
the warp threads. Natural colored black and
brown wools and brown camels' hair are frequently
used and they are, of course, durable.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the increasing demand
in this country for the Eastern rug, together with
the Russian influence in the Orient, tends towards
more hasty commercial methods of manufacture
and is, to a great extent, responsible for the
introduction there of aniline dyes. The coal tar
products have been readily accepted by the
Eastern dyers, as they are cheaper, more easily
used, and offer a greater number of brilliant
shades, all of which appeal very much to the
Oriental taste.</p>

<p>The aniline dyes are more commonly used
through Asia Minor and, to some extent, in the
Caucasus and even in Persia. In 1903 a law was
enacted by the Persian government forbidding
the importation of chemical dyes and seizing and
destroying all fabrics in which they were used. It
was also decreed that a dyer found guilty of using
them would have his right hand cut off. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg. 78]</a></span>
government has never been very strict in enforcing
this law, else there would be at the present
time many one-handed men in Persia.</p>

<p>As there is no such law in Asia Minor, fully
seventy-five per cent. of the rugs now imported
from that country are aniline dyed. The Kurdistan,
Khorasan, and Kirman products, as well as
those made by the Nomads in the Fars district
of Persia, have been particularly free from outside
influences and as a rule are honestly dyed.</p>

<p>The nomadic life of the Kurds in former times
enabled them to gather plants more easily and so
they were able to obtain good vegetable dyes.
Now that they do not roam as much the result is,
less vegetable and more aniline dyes. Formerly
also, the best wool only was used by the Kurds
for the making of rugs and the women chose only
that which they knew would take the colors well.
Now the men sell the best part of the wool and
the women use what is left and press aniline dyes
into service to hide any possible defect.</p>

<p>Some of the coal tar products will resist light,
water, and air even better than many of the vegetable
pigments, but the former have a tendency
to make the wool fibres more brittle so that they
break easily, while the latter preserve the wool
and lengthen the life of the fabric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg. 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Each nation uses to a large extent its favorite
color, thus the Persian is partial to the dark
greens and yellows, the Turk to the reds, and the
Armenian to the blues. Asia Minor and Persia
being countries of intense sunshine, in which the
colors of the sky and land are most pronounced,
the neutral tints and hues make little impression
on such surroundings and are therefore little
used. All the rug making people use more or less
yellow, blue, orange, red, ruby, and green, excepting
the Turk, who regards the latter as a sacred
color and not to be trodden on. He therefore
seldom uses it in any but those of the prayer
design.</p>

<p>An expert can often distinguish between an
aniline dyed rug and a vegetable dyed one merely
by feeling of it, as the coal tar product robs the
wool of its oil, making it stiffer, harder, and dryer.
Another way to differentiate is to examine some
of the white which lies next to some bright color
like blue, red, orange, or green and see if it has
become tinted with the brighter color. If not,
wet the two and after they dry see if the white
has taken any of the other color. If so it is probably
aniline. In the Orient they use a string of
amber beads with which to test the dyes. The
beads are drawn over the surface of the rug so
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg. 80]</a></span>
that the colors reflect through them. If aniline
they are said to have a cloudy appearance,
while if vegetable they have a clear wavy appearance.
If there is any knowledge imparted by this
test it certainly is only in the hands of the experienced.
A vegetable dye will fade into a lighter
tone of itself, while in a chemical dye some one
of the colors used to make up the composite color
will disappear. For instance a blue, which has
been used with yellow to make green, may entirely
disappear, leaving the yellow; thus in the aniline
product the surface will show the changed color
and the original color will show down next to the
warp, while in the vegetable dyed product there
will simply be two shades of the same color.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Weavers frequently choose colors according
to their symbolic significance, so that they work
into their rugs a sort of poetry which only the
initiated can read. Thus to the Persian, the
Chinese, and the Indian Mohammedan, white is an
emblem of mourning; green is regarded by the
Mohammedan as a sacred color and denotes
immortality; blue to the Persian means air, while
to the Mongolian it means authority and power;
black denotes sorrow, evil, and vice; red denotes
joy, happiness, life, truth, virtue, and sincerity;
yellow is a Chinese color for royalty; orange is
the Buddhist and Mohammedan color for sorrow,
and rose for divine wisdom. The following is a
list of some of the most common Oriental colors
with a short description of the sources from which
they are derived:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg. 81]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span>&mdash;The best and most lasting is the rich
carmine known as Kermes and consists of dried
insects which live on a species of oak tree. These
insects are collected in the month of June and are
killed by being exposed to the vapors of acetic
acid evolved by heating vinegar. Kermes was
known to have been used in Syria in the time of
Moses, and is probably the most lasting and most
preservative of all dyestuffs. Of late years, however,
it has been to a large extent supplemented
by cochineal, which is more brilliant. Madder root,
ground and boiled, is the basis of a multitude of
reds and is also noted for its fastness. From it can
be obtained many degrees of red from pink to
intense scarlet, but the shade most commonly
used by the Persians of to-day is obtained by
combining madder with alum and grape juice.
Although cochineal is used considerably by
Eastern dyers, it is really a modern dye, being
obtained from dried insects which are found on
the cacti of Mexico. It gives soft, beautiful reds,
is absolutely fast and is very expensive. With
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg. 82]</a></span>
bichromate of potash it gives purple; with sulphuric
acid, crimson and scarlet, and with madder,
cherry and various shades of pink. One of the
best, richest and most lasting vermilions was
made by a secret process from sheep's blood, but
the secret has long since been lost. In recent
years many reds have had as a basis the dye
woods, such as Campeachy wood, Brazil wood, and
others. They are sometimes obtained from onion
skins, ivy berries, beets, and other plants, but
these latter pigments are not as enduring as those
previously mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue.</span>&mdash;Indigo dissolved in sulphuric acid, to
which is added alum, forms a basis of most blues
and was used long before the Christian era. It
is obtained from the leaves of various specimens
of Indigofera which are cultivated largely in
India. The deep Persian blue is obtained by
applying indigo over madder. It can be compounded
with almost any other dyeing material
known and it is by this mixing process that beautiful
violets, porcelain blues and pinks are
obtained. A superb dark blue found in some of
the antique Persian rugs has been in disuse for
nearly a half century. The secret of making it
seems to have been lost and no one has been able
to reproduce it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg. 83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green.</span>&mdash;Indigo in combination with one of
the yellows furnishes most of the greens. With
buckthorn it produces Chinese greens, both bright
and dull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown.</span>&mdash;Browns are most frequently obtained
by mixing madder with yellow or by dyeing with
madder over yellow. Valonia, catechu, gall-nuts,
and the green husks of walnuts also enter largely
into the making of browns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow.</span>&mdash;The principal yellows are obtained
from the Persian berries, from turmeric, from
saffron and sumac roots. Persian berries give a
fast dull yellow. Turmeric is from the root of a
plant growing abundantly in East India and
China and it gives a bright orange color. Orange
yellow is also obtained from henna and by combining
madder and turmeric. A light yellow is
obtained from larkspur; a greenish yellow from
a fungus of the mulberry, and, of late years, a
buff colored yellow has been obtained from quercitron
bark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>&mdash;Black seems to be the only color
which the rug makers of older days were unable
to produce from vegetable or animal sources.
The principal black used was that made from iron
filings with vinegar and pomegranate rind, but
it destroyed the fibres of the wool. For this
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg. 84]</a></span>
reason very little black was used in the antique
pieces excepting where the fleece of black sheep
could be obtained. Nowadays logwood, which
grows in Central America, is the essential basis
of all blacks in wool, although other colors are
frequently used with it to modify or intensify
the shade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Purple.</span>&mdash;From very early times the Ph&#339;nicians
were renowned for a purple which they
obtained from a shellfish found in the Ã†gean Sea,
but the secret of making it has long since become
a lost art. A great many shades of purple, heliotrope
and lavender are obtained from the different
red dyes in combination with indigo and the
dye woods as well as from the bodies of marine
insects and mollusks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gray.</span>&mdash;Gray is secured from Smyrna gall-nuts
with copperas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmon.</span>&mdash;Salmon is obtained by mixing
madder with valonia.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Violet.</span>&mdash;Violet is frequently made from milk,
sour grape juice, madder and water.</p>

<h2>WEAVING AND WEAVERS</h2>


<p>The method of weaving in the Orient to-day is
practically the same as it was one thousand years
ago with the exception, perhaps, that there are
now fewer crooked fabrics woven than in the days
gone by. Next to the quality of the material from
which it is made, and the dye with which it is
colored, the splendid durability of the Oriental
rug is due to the manner in which the pile is
tied to the warp thread. It is so secure that
it is impossible to remove it by pulling either
end of the knot. This differs from the domestic
method in which the pile is merely drawn between
the warp threads without tying or fastening. In
the finer fabrics of the East the knots are so close
that it requires careful examination to discover
them except in very old rugs where the pile is
worn down, then the knot is distinctly seen.</p>

<p>In some parts of Persia the best artisans are
men but in most other sections the weavers are
mostly women and children. The latter begin
working at the loom as early as four or five years
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg. 88]</a></span>
of age and serve an apprenticeship of two years,
after which they receive a few pennies a day. A
skilful woman weaver will earn from three to six
shillings a week and they usually work from sunrise
to sunset, week after week, month after
month, year after year. As a rule they have no
education, can neither read nor write, and have
absolutely nothing else to do but weave and gossip.
Rug weaving proves a sort of an amusement and
a source of income; besides they take a great
interest in the work and the height of their ambition
is to realize hope of royal recognition for
their superior workmanship.</p>

<p>Each rug is given in charge of a master weaver
who usually gets one anna (two cents) for every
eleven hundred knots tied. He it is who hires
and pays the weavers and makes himself responsible
for the quality of the work done.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The girls, especially those of Asia Minor, frequently
buy with their earnings perforated gold
coins with which to decorate themselves by making
them into necklaces or bracelets or by arranging
them on their headgear. These coins not only
serve to make known their skill as weavers, but
also answer as dowries for their future husbands.
A skilful weaver can tie from twelve to fourteen
knots a minute or from seven to eight thousand
knots a day. This would be equal to from fourteen
square inches to three square feet, according
to the fineness of the rug. For this she receives,
on the average, nine cents a day. For a rug 10 Ã— 6
with 182 knots to the square inch, she would receive,
in rough figures, from $18.00 to $20.00, and
the rug would sell in Constantinople for no less
than $75.00. If the women of the Orient are ever
emancipated we will have to pay much higher
prices for Eastern carpets than we do now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg. 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Eastern loom, which is the same to-day as
it was a thousand years ago, consists merely of
four poles joined together by ropes according to
the size of the rug to be woven. On these the
warp threads are strung and kept at the proper
tension by weights, which are attached to one of
the cross poles.</p>

<p class="pmb2">From one to six, or even more, weavers work
on a rug at the same time, according to its size.
They sit cross-legged either on the floor or on a
raised frame, so that their work will be on a level
with their knees. Before them, as seen in the
accompanying illustration, is fastened the model
which they are to follow or what is known as the
"talim," a chart which indicates the colors to
be used and the number of knots to be tied in
each color. Like expert pianists their fingers
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg. 90]</a></span>
seem to know the pattern and much of the time
their eyes are not even upon the work.</p>

<p class="pmb2">In many cases the head weaver sings these
symbols for the benefit of the other weavers.
Among the Nomads the design is frequently kept
in the brain, or roughly drawn on paper or in the
sand. If they have another rug as a model they
get the right design by simply counting on the
back the number of knots of every color in each
row. Beginning at the bottom and working
towards the right, the wool yarn, which goes to
form the pile, is looped around the warp threads
by the aid of blunt pointed needles and then tied
in such a way that by each knotting two of the
warp threads are bound. When the Turkish knot
is used, these two threads are bound side by side.
When the Persian knot is used, if tied tightly, one
is bound in front of the other. This process is
repeated along the line with the proper colors
required by the patterns and after each row of
knots one or more weft threads are passed
through between the warp threads and then
beaten down with a sort of comb, the teeth of
which pass between the warp threads. The pile
is then trimmed off with the scissors to the desired
length. The Caucasians and Kurds, as a rule, leave
a long pile, while the Turkomans and Persians
clip theirs quite short. Close trimming brings out
more minutely the color variations. The number
of knots to the square inch is determined by the
closeness of the warp threads and the number of
weft threads thrown across after each row, also
by the thickness of these threads. The tighter and
closer the knots are tied the more perpendicular
the pile and more durable the fabric. In coarse
fabrics, like the Kazak, there are usually four or
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg. 92]</a></span>
five weft threads between each row of knots. In
such fabrics the rows of pile yarn overlap, thus
giving it ample opportunity to untwist and become
more lustrous. This is why the loosely
woven, long naped rugs have more sheen than do
the tightly woven short naped ones. Uneven
trimming of the pile or unskilled use of the comb
will produce unevenness in the completed rug.</p>

    <span class="minor">A Wooden Comb.</span>
</div>
<p class="pmb3" />

<p class="pmb2">The fewer and the lighter the weft threads
are, the more flexible is the rug. The great depth
of pile is also a good feature in certain rugs, as
the heavier the fabric is the better it will lie.
Stronger warp threads are usually put on each
side to strengthen and give better support to the
weft and sometimes both warp and weft are dyed,
either in toto or at the ends only, in order to give
a colored webbing to the finished product.</p>

<p class="pmb2">As a rule the nap of all rugs which are tied
with the Ghiordes knot runs directly towards one
end, while those that are tied with the Senna knot
have a nap which runs towards one corner, right
or left, according to whether the right or left
Senna knot is employed. Frequently rugs are
found with either the Ghiordes or the Senna knot
where the nap runs directly towards one side.
This may be due to an untwisting of the pile yarn
or to the washing process, the washer in such cases
having scraped the water out towards the side of
the rug instead of towards the end.</p>

<h2>DESIGNS AND THEIR SYMBOLISM</h2>


<p>The soul of the Oriental is in his design, which
is invariably well composed of skilfully conventionalized
figures and superbly rich, harmonious
colorings of which one never tires, while that of
the European has a stiff set pattern which soon
fails to attract.</p>

<p>The transmission of ancient patterns has been
going on from century to century, the old designs
and colorings being copied by the weavers from
one generation to another and many of those used
at the present time are doubtless the same that
were used in the time of Abraham.</p>

<p>Each district, tribe or family had its characteristic
patterns and color combinations which
were regarded as its individual inheritance and
were never copied by other districts, tribes or
families. So it is possible for the expert to tell
the locality from which an antique rug came, but
the source of the modern one is not quite as accurately
determined on account of the changes in
designs brought about by the influence of immigration,
travel and conquest. A design may be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg. 98]</a></span>
borrowed by a neighboring province and gradually
undergo changes according to the taste of
the adopting people until its original form is completely
lost. The patterns have also become limited
in number, so that to-day the entire output
of Persian fabrics comprises only about thirty
original designs, but of these the varieties of form,
arrangement and combination are very large.
Turkey and India have even, in some instances,
adopted European designs. The Nomad products
are perhaps the freest of all from outside
influences.</p>

<p class="pmb2">In the way of characterization we might state
that the Persian designs are usually floral, while
the Turkish designs are for the most part a mixture
of the floral and the geometrical, the former
being much less natural than those of the Persians.
Caucasian and Turkoman designs are
nearly always geometrical. Occasionally they are
floral but of a rectilineal nature and never connected
with wavy lines as in the Persian. The
Kurdish designs are more like the Persian, while
the Chinese consist largely of dragons, monsters,
and animals of all sorts. It is curious to note
how the Persians make many patterns out of one
design by employing various methods of coloring.
Even when the same colors are used there is
always a great dissimilarity between the different
makes of the same design.</p>

<p>Sir George Birdwood says, "Whatever their
type of ornamentation may be, a deep and complicated
symbolism, originating in Babylon and
possibly India, pervades every denomination of
Oriental carpets." The geometrical figures, floral
designs and the figures of animals and beings all
carry with them a mystical, poetical idea of
religious sentiment, the study of which, though
difficult, is very fascinating to one who has the
ability to interpret them. It seems perfectly
natural that the Oriental who is so passionately
devoted to symbols should profusely weave them
into his fabrics. The Turks, being orthodox
Mohammedans, never weave figures of animals,
birds or human beings into their rugs, as the
teachings of the Koran forbid it lest it should
lead to idolatry. Neither do they, as a rule, make
their rugs symmetrical, their idea being to symbolize
the fact that only Allah is perfect. The
Persians and Chinese, however, being more liberal,
exercise greater freedom in these respects,
and in some of their old hunting rugs, of which
but few remain, are depicted animals of all kinds.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us that the weaver, who
worked day after day for months and sometimes
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg. 100]</a></span>
for years on a single piece, seldom signed or dated
it. I have seldom seen the name of the weaver,
of the place of manufacture, or the date, on an
antique rug. Many of the modern commercial
pieces are provided with dates to make them more
attractive to the buyer. Inscriptions, on the other
hand, are frequently found in rugs of all ages
and are most frequently on the borders. As a
rule they are prayers or quotations from the
Koran or poems from the writings of some
famous Persian poet and with but few exceptions
are in the Arabic language. The ability to read
these inscriptions adds greatly to the charm and
interest of their possession.</p>

<p>The date, when present, will usually be found
in one corner of the rug, sometimes in the border
on one side or end, and should be read from left to
right. If the spot is well worn and the figures are
indistinct turn the rug over and read on the back
from right to left.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The following are the Arabic figures, of which
there are numerous modifications:</p>

      Even the novice can tell at a glance that this is not purely an Oriental product;
      it so closely resembles the Domestic carpet.</span>

<p>If we will but remember that the Mohammedan
reckoning began on July 16, 622, A.D., when
Mohammed made his pilgrimage to Mecca, and
that the Mohammedan year consists of thirty-three
days less than ours, it will be easy to find
the year in our calendar corresponding to a given
year in the Mohammedan. The rule is to subtract
from the Mohammedan year one thirty-third of
itself and add 622 to the remainder; thus,
1331 Ã· 33 = 40 (do nothing with the fraction),
1331-40 = 1291 + 622 = 1913.</p>

<p>The following is an alphabetically arranged
list of the different designs with descriptions and
suggestive drawings of the same. For that part
referring to the Chinese and Indian mythology
the author is greatly indebted to Prof. Du Bois
Reymond of Shanghai, China, and to Mr. B. A.
Gupte, F. Z. S., of Calcutta, India, respectively:</p>

<img src="images/illus145.jpg" alt="Angular Hook." />
</div>
<p class="pmb2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Angular Hook or Latch Hook.</span>&mdash;A modification
of the Swastika and carries the same meaning.
It has been called the trade-mark of the
Caucasian rugs, in which it is almost invariably
used; in fact, it is apparent in nearly all of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg. 102]</a></span>
Western Asia designs. With the Chinese the
latch hook stands for privacy. (See colored plate
at p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, also doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_264">264</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthemion or Hom</span> consists of an alternate
bud and fir cone arrangement with strong lateral
markings. It is frequently used as a flower on
the sacred tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple,</span> see Silibik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ball and Claw.</span>&mdash;Similar to that used on the
legs of chairs and tables of the 17th and 18th
centuries.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Barber-Pole Stripe</span> (a border design).&mdash;An
alternate arrangement of diagonal stripes of red
and white or blue and white, found more or less
in the borders of rugs from all parts of the Orient,
especially the Caucasian products. Frequently
the stripes carry some small decorative pattern.
(See colored plate at p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>, also doubletones at
pp. <a href="#Page_204">204</a> and <a href="#Page_254">254</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Basket.</span>&mdash;One of the Chinese Buddhist ornaments.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Bat.</span>&mdash;A Chinese design which is symbolic of
happiness. Found quite commonly in the Chinese
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg. 103]</a></span>
fabrics. Five bats often appear in the centre of
Chinese rugs and represent riches, longevity,
health, love of virtue and peaceful end.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus147a.jpg" alt="Bat." />
</div>
<p class="pmb2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Beads.</span>&mdash;The rosary was anciently used to
record time, and a circle, being a line without
termination, was the natural emblem of its perpetual
continuity; hence we find circles of beads
upon the heads of deities and enclosing the sacred
symbols upon coins and other ornaments. Beads
are always carried by the Mohammedans to assist
them in their prayers. The Moslem rosary consists
of ninety-nine beads, each one designating
one of the ninety-nine beautiful names of Allah.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Bee.</span>&mdash;In China it is symbolic of many descendants.
In India it has been adopted from British
associations and represents industry, but is not
regarded as an old symbol.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus147b.jpg" alt="Bee." />
</div>
<p class="pmb2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Beetle or ScarabÃ¦us.</span>&mdash;A Chinese symbol of
creation, resurrection or new life. In India it is
a symbol of royalty. Wings of the gold beetle are
used in decorating peacock feather fans and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg. 104]</a></span>
morchels or royal fly flaps. As the blue beetle
it represents one that lives on honey and is portrayed
near the form of a young lady whose lotus-like
face it is supposed to have mistaken for
that flower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boar.</span>&mdash;In India a boar with a ball on its right
tusk represents Vishnu the Protector in his third
incarnation when he lifted up and saved the earth
from being engulfed by the great flood (the
deluge).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bouquet</span>, see Pear.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Butterfly.</span>&mdash;The Chinese symbol of vanity.
In India it was not used in the older decoration,
but in modern decoration it has the associations
of a flirt, owing to English environments. Butterfly
forms are frequently found in Chinese rugs
intermingled with those of bats.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="pmb2" />

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Bow Knot.</span>&mdash;As one of the emblems of Buddha
it is used in Chinese and Japanese ornament and
is often found in the border of Chinese rugs.
Sometimes it partakes of a floral character in
the Shiraz and Kirman rugs and is very commonly
found in the Shemakha weaving, where it is a
talismanic design.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Caucasian Border Design.</span>&mdash;So called by the

commencement and no end. In India it is considered
inauspicious. It is related that one of the
Maharajahs of India returned a costly landau to a
British manufacturer because it had circles of
embroidered tape on its cushions.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Cloud, Chinese</span>, is one of the most famous of
the Mongolian patterns, although it is frequently
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg. 107]</a></span>
found in Caucasian and Kurdish fabrics. It is
symbolic of immortality and represents the constellation
of Ursa Major, in which, by the Mongolian,
the great Ruler was supposed to reside.
(See doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a> and color plate at p. <a href="#Page_300">300</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat of Arms, Persian</span> (see illustration on
p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a>).&mdash;Consists of a lion holding an uplifted
sword in its right paw and the rising sun dominating
from its back. Persians from their
earliest history have worshipped the sun. The
lion was added about eight hundred years ago,
it being the emblem of one of the Nomadic tribes
who were conquered by the Persians. The sword
signifies the absolute power of the Persian rulers.
This emblem is used on their flag and coins as
well as in decoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat of Arms, Russian</span> (see illustration on
p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>).&mdash;The Russian double eagle is occasionally
found in old Kazaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coat of Arms, Turkish</span> (see illustration on
p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>).&mdash;Rudely represents a left hand, originated,
it is said, by a Sultan who sealed the treaty of
Ragusa with the imprint of his hand after dipping
it in blood. It now appears on the Turkish
stamps, coins and many of their public documents.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Comb.</span>&mdash;An emblem of the Mohammedan faith
to remind the devout that cleanliness is next to
godliness. For this reason it appears in its various
forms near the niche of many prayer rugs,
especially in the Daghestans.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Crab.</span>&mdash;A border design having the appearance
of a series of crabs with their claws extended.
Very common in the Caucasian fabrics, especially
the Kazaks. (See doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus154b.jpg" alt="Crab." />
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Crane.</span>&mdash;In India the crane is symbolic of a
rogue, a cheat, a false prophet, a religious hypocrite.
Crane-like (bakavrata) means hypocrisy.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg. 109]</a></span>
A poet addressing a crane said, "You stand on
one leg like a devotee performing austerities, but
you can only cheat senseless fishes. Your hypocrisy
is well known to the learned; they are aware
of it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crescent.</span>&mdash;In China the crescent is symbolic
of coming events. In India it signifies descent in
the lunar line of kings of the warrior race (Kehatriya)
or it indicates Mohammedan faith. When
used as a tattoo mark it is associated with a little
star below it and it means the devoted love of
Rohini (Venus) to the moon (who is masculine in
Indian mythology).</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Crocodile.</span>&mdash;In Indian mythology, when drawn
with a female figure seated on it, it signifies the
Goddess Ganga (personification of the river
Ganges); when drawn as holding an elephant
in its tremendous jaws, it shows distress and
tenacity.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Cross, Greek</span> (sometimes called the Square

are woven by the orthodox Mohammedans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crow.</span>&mdash;Chinese, harbinger of bad luck; Indian,
an evil foreboder among the Hindus and a good
omen among the Mohammedans. It is said that
Sir Salar Jang, the late Minister of Hyderabad,
always looked at a crow the first thing in the
morning and that one of his attendants was told
oft to stand with a crow in a cage facing his

towards animals because of its association with
Shakuntala in the Lost Ring, a very popular
drama by Kalidas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diamond.</span>&mdash;Found in rugs of most every class,
but more especially in those of the Caucasus. As

<p class="p2 pmb3"><span class="smcap">Herati.</span>&mdash;Also known as the fish, twin fish and
Feraghan designs. Better known as the Herati.
It originated in the old city of Herat. It consists
of a rosette between two lancet-shaped leaves
which very much resemble fish. On account of
this resemblance it is often called the fish pattern.
It has been utilized with many modifications in
half of the rug-making sections of the Orient. It
may be found in its original form in many of the
Persian fabrics, especially the Herat, the Feraghan,
the Khorasan, and the Senna. When in
the body of the rug it is generally arranged as a
diaper, covering all or a considerable portion of
it. Sometimes it appears in combination with
square or diamond-shaped figures. The Herati
border is found in a great many of the Persian
and in some of the Caucasian fabrics. (See color

with the exception that the color is of a brilliant
purple on the border petals with a heart of deep
orange and the stem stands high out of the water.
It is commonly found on the banks of the Nile
and is the first flower to spring up after the overflowing
waters of that river have subsided. For
this reason and because it preserves its chaste
beauty while growing from such impure surroundings
it has always figured among the
Egyptians as an emblem of immortality and
purity. With the Chinese it is symbolic of many
descendants and in India it is especially sacred to
the Buddhists and is the national flower of that
country. In ornament the lotus is handled by
many different nations, being used in both circular
and profile forms, figuring as flowers, wheels,
medallions, etc.</p>

"pole medallion," in which the ends of the design
project out like a pole, is especially common to the
rugs of Hamadan and Shiraz. In the Chinese
rugs the medallion is usually of the form known
as the Circle of Happiness. (See doubletones at

<p class="p2 pmb3"><span class="smcap">Pear.</span>&mdash;Also known as the cone, the palm leaf,
the river loop, the crown jewel, the seal, the
almond, the feather, the bouquet, and the flame.
There is a vast difference of opinion as to the
origin and meaning of this motif. Some authorities
claim it was intended for the fir cone, which
served as an emblem of immortality and was
revered by the ancients; some say it was intended
for the palm leaf, which has been handed down
by the Greeks as a symbol of victory; others say
it was intended to represent a loop which the
river Indus makes on a vast plain in upper Cashmere
as seen from the Mosque. By some it is
said to represent the crown jewels or chief ornament
in the old Iranian crown, which is a composite
jewel of pear shape. A great many believe
it to represent an ancient seal which was made by
the closed hand after dipping it in human blood.
Tradition tells us that the signing of documents
in such a manner was a custom well known in the
East. This design has also been called the
almond, the feather, the bouquet, and the flame
on account of its fancied resemblance to these
objects. We have selected the name "pear"
because the image it conveys is more clearly recognized
by the western mind. It is that which its
shape most suggests. The Pear design is common
in many kinds of rugs, especially in those of
Persia and Kurdistan, but it varies greatly in
varieties of form and size. The large size is
usually employed in the Caucasus and Southern
Persia, while the small size is used more frequently
in Central and Western Persia. In the
Saraband, Shiraz, Herat, Khorasan, and Senna,
it frequently covers the whole field. In the two
former alternate rows usually have the stems of
the pears turned in opposite directions, while in
the three latter the stems are usually turned in
the same direction. (See doubletones at pp. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>,

<p><span class="smcap">Scroll.</span>&mdash;One of the distinctive Mongolian

<p><span class="smcap">Seal of Solomon</span>, see Solomon's Seal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serpent.</span>&mdash;In India it is inauspicious because
it reminds one of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shah Abbas</span> (see border design in cut of
Ispahan rug at p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>).&mdash;Named after the most
revered of monarchs, who was born in 1586 and
died in 1628. It is one of the most beautiful of
the ancient designs. It consists of yellow, red,
and blue flowers with connecting vines upon a
background of blue. The so-called Shah Abbas
design of to-day has very little resemblance to the
ancient design. (See color plate at p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a> and
doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>.)</p>

more or less in the majority of the Caucasian
products, but more especially in the Shirvans.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Signet of David.</span>&mdash;Based upon the equilateral

Turkish designs. See Star, six-pointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silibik or Apple.</span>&mdash;A Kurdish design which

<p><span class="smcap">Square.</span>&mdash;Found in the rugs of nearly every

It apparently has no special symbolic significance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Square Cross</span>, see Cross, Greek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squirrel.</span>&mdash;In India it is sacred to Rana, the
seventh incarnation of Vishnu, because while his
monkey army was building a bridge for him to
go over to Ceylon this little creature was seen
repeatedly rolling into the sand of the beach and
washing the grains, which adhered to its bushy
coat, into the sea. Rana inquired why it took so
much trouble and the reply was that it was taking
sand down to the sea to reclaim the land or fill up
the gap between Ceylon and India and to facilitate
the construction of the bridge. Rana was so
pleased that he passed his fingers coaxingly over
its body and said that the sacred marks thus produced
on its back would protect it. The stripes
on the squirrel's back are still believed to be
Rana's finger marks and no good Hindu, therefore,
will kill a squirrel. Its presence is auspicious,
signifying Divine protection.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Star.</span>&mdash;An emblem seen the world over in decoration,
especially in synagogues. It is common in
the Caucasian and Turkoman products, especially
in the form of the elongated eight-pointed star.
This eight-pointed star in the centre of an octagon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg. 133]</a></span>
is said to have represented the Deity of the ancient
Medes. In all probability the six-pointed star
was an adaptation of the Shield of David. It is
supposed to have been symbolic of divinity. To
it may be traced scores of Turkish patterns. (See
doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_162">162</a> and color plate at p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>.)</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Stork.</span>&mdash;Chinese, longevity. Indian&mdash;the Indian
heron has been associated with cunning
and deceit. It is said that it stands on one leg
like an Indian ascetic as if it had been performing
austerities, but as soon as a fish comes within
reach it pounces on it and devours it. People who
assume the garb of religious men and cheat others
are called (bak) storks, herons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunburst</span>, see Palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swan.</span>&mdash;In India the swan is the charger of
Brahma.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Swastika.</span>&mdash;Derived from the Sanscrit word
Svasti, which means good pretence. It dates back
three or four thousand years B.C. and has been
found in nearly all excavations of prehistoric
times and among the relics of primitive people all
over the world. It has been known alike to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg. 134]</a></span>
Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Japanese,
East Indians, Aztecs, mound builders, and the
North and South American Indians, with all of
whom it has a similar meaning, viz., good luck and
happiness. In India it is drawn below the seats
intended for bridegrooms, below the plates containing
food to be offered to gods and is tattooed
on the arms. It is drawn on the scalp at the thread
ceremony and on the dorsum of the feet on all
auspicious ceremonies, such as marriages, etc.
The usual figure consists of four arms with the
cross at right angles and the arms pointing in the
direction of motion of a clock's hand, although it
has been given different forms, as shown by the
accompanying illustrations. It is very commonly
used as a rug design, especially in the Chinese,
Caucasian, Turkish, and Turkoman products. (See

in which the figure of the tortoise is arrayed in
a manner similar to that of the Herati border
design. In China the tortoise stands for longevity
and immortality. In India it is also
auspicious inasmuch as it represents the second
incarnation of Vishnu where it supports the earth
on its back. (See doubletones at pp. <a href="#Page_178">178</a> and <a href="#Page_202">202</a>.)</p>

<p class="p2 pmb2"><span class="smcap">Tree.</span>&mdash;Sometimes called the tree of life.
Always associated with religious belief. It symbolizes
Divine power and perpetual life. It has
furnished more different art motives than any
other object and is almost omnipresent in Persian
prayer rugs. The palm signifies a blessing or
benediction, the weeping willow stands for death,
and the cypress, while being an emblem of mourning,
in its perennial freshness and the durability
of its wood, is also a very practical symbol of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg. 137]</a></span>
life to come. It is an Oriental custom to plant
cypress trees on the graves of the dead, to place
its twigs in the coffins of the dead, and to use
its branches to indicate the houses of mourning.
(See frontispiece and doubletone at p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>.) In
India the cocoanut palm is considered "the tree
of desire" or one that fulfils all desires. Its stem
serves as a pillar or beam, as a water conduit and as
fuel; its leaves supply mats for roofing the houses;
its kernel supplies oil; its shell makes water bowls,
and the oil of the shell is used as an external application
in certain skin affections, etc. It is all useful
and supplies all the primitive wants and therefore
was much cultivated by the Rishis (Saints)
of old, who called it "kalpa taru," literally the
tree that supplies all desires. Its presence therefore
is auspicious. (See color plate at p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>; also

<h2>THE IDENTIFICATION OF RUGS</h2>


<p>The one thing desired by those who are just
beginning the study of Oriental rugs is the ability
to readily identify them. Realizing this, the
author has included a chapter on the identification
of rugs which contains many features new to rug
literature and which, he trusts, will greatly
simplify and render easy the process of identification;
but it must be borne in mind that certain
rugs are much more easily distinguished than
others and that at times even the connoisseur is
puzzled.</p>

<p>Oriental rugs are identified not alone by their
designs and colors, but by their material, texture
and finish, therefore, there is given first, a list
of those which are distinguishable by their outstanding
or prominent characteristics; second,
reproductions of the backs of those rugs which
are characteristic in their appearance, and third,
an exhaustive chart giving complete details as to
weave, material, texture and finish of each variety
of rug.</p>

<p>The chapter on Design, which precedes this,
is the most complete consideration ever given to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg. 148]</a></span>
this detail of rug making, and its numerous
descriptions and drawings will enable the reader
to identify, with reasonable certainty, rugs by this
feature alone.</p>

<p>The numerous pictures of the representative
types of rugs will also familiarize the readers
with many distinguishing patterns, while the chapters
in Part II take up and gather together all of
the various features of each kind of rug upon the
market, so arranged and described that a clear
and comprehensive idea of it will be formed in
the mind of the reader.</p>


<h3>A FEW CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF
CERTAIN RUGS</h3>

<p>Named in the order of their importance and
given to assist the reader in differentiating,
although few are absolute criterions.</p>

<p class="p2">By carefully consulting these characteristics
and the chart of distinguishing features it ought
to be a comparatively easy matter to take up
almost any rug and name it after a few moments'
reflection. To illustrate, try your skill on the
following description: Knot&mdash;Senna, weave close
and rows of knots very uneven; warp and woof
both of undyed cotton. Pile of very fine wool,
short and upright; ends both have narrow white
webs through which runs a strand of parti-colored
yarn. There is also a fringe of loose warp ends.
The sides are overcast with silk. There is a
diamond-shaped pole medallion upon a field which
is covered with a minute Herati design; the colors
are subdued shades of red, blue, green, yellow and
old rose with more or less white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg. 152]</a></span></p>

<p>After consulting the table of distinguishing
features you will find that the Senna knot excludes
all Caucasian and Turkish fabrics; the
cotton warp and woof excludes all Turkoman
fabrics excepting the Kashgar and the Yarkand.
The overcasting of the sides, as well as the Herati
design, excludes these two, therefore it must belong
to the Persian class. A great many of this class
are tied with the Senna knot; have cotton warp
and woof; a short, upright wool pile and narrow
webs with loose warp ends, but only two are ever
overcast with silk, namely the Senna and the
Saruk. Upon referring to the characteristic
features mentioned in the first part of this chapter
(page <a href="#Page_148">148</a>) you will see that the Herati design
is common to both of these rugs, but that the uneven
weave, the pole medallion and the strand
of colored yarn in the web are all Senna features,
therefore you have a Senna.</p>

<p>A thorough knowledge of designs and colors
would have enabled you to name the piece at
first sight, as would also the character of the
weave in this particular instance.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Most of the prayer rugs may be accurately
classified by consulting the chart illustrating rug
niches (page <a href="#Page_322">322</a>), while the distinguishing characteristics
of the different Ghileems may be found
in the chapter on Ghileems.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE BACKS OF SOME RUGS<br />
SHOWING THEIR CHARACTERISTIC WEAVES</h3>

<p>The author has endeavored to include in this
group of pictures one of every rug which has a
distinct characteristic weave. There are many
rugs, the weaves of which differ so minutely that
their reproduction on paper would be of no
material help.</p>

<p>The details of each picture are of the same
size as the rug from which it was taken and
each one is presented with the warp threads
running up and down. This idea of comparison
would be even more valuable were it possible to
procure pictures of pieces only which have the
same number of knots to the square inch. A
magnifying glass will aid materially in bringing
out the minute details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 1. Khorasan.</span>&mdash;Twelve knots to the inch vertically,
and six horizontally. This peculiar weave is due to the fact
that several rows of knots are tied with no woof thread to
separate them; then two or three strands of the woof are
thrown in, one after the other, followed by several more rows
of knots. This method of weaving is a Khorasan feature.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 2. Senna.</span>&mdash;Eighteen Senna knots to the inch vertically,
and eighteen horizontally. Notice the closeness and irregularity
of the rows of knots. Contrast the appearance of this with that
of the Saruk (No. 3) which is tied with the same kind of
knot and has very nearly the same number to the square inch.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 3. Saruk.</span>&mdash;Fifteen Senna knots to the inch vertically,
and sixteen horizontally. One of the most closely and most
evenly woven of the Oriental fabrics. In this illustration the
rows of knots can easily be counted horizontally, but it is almost
impossible to count them vertically unless we follow the stripe-like
arrangement in the straight oblique outlines of some of the
designs.</span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg. 154]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 4. Kazak.</span>&mdash;Six Ghiordes knots to the inch vertically,
and nine horizontally. Notice the wide spacing between each
row. This is due to the great number of woof threads between
each row, a characteristic of the Kazak. This cut beautifully
illustrates the appearance of the Ghiordes knot on the back.
Note that each one has two loops as compared with the one
loop in the Senna knot, as illustrated in No. 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 5. Saraband.</span>&mdash;Ten Senna knots to the inch vertically
and ten horizontally. The white or light blue woof threads are
distinctly seen in each row, even in those which are closely
woven. The spaces between the rows vary a little in places,
giving it an appearance somewhat similar to the Khorasan
weave.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 6. Daghestan.</span>&mdash;Eight Ghiordes knots to the inch
vertically, and eight horizontally. This piece has the same
number of knots to the square inch as does the Chinese (No. 7),
and, although of a different kind, the appearance of the weave
is quite similar.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 7. Chinese.</span>&mdash;Nine knots to the inch vertically, and
nine horizontally. The spiral appearance of the colored rows
of knots and the white woof threads give it a look quite similar
to that of the Daghestan (No. 6).</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 8. Merve Ghileem.</span>&mdash;Eight stitches to the inch. Compare
the difference in weave to that of the Kurdish ghileem
(No. 9). The colors of the latter are always at right angles
to or with the warp and woof threads, while that of the
former is diagonal to the warp and woof threads. This method
of weaving gives the Merve fewer and smaller open spaces.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 9. Kurdish Ghileem.</span>&mdash;Notice the many open spaces,
also the loose yarn ends, a characteristic of this class of ghileems.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg. 155]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 10. Shemakha</span> (coarse).&mdash;Eight stitches to the inch.
Showing the front of the rug in order to illustrate the Shemakha
weave, which is a flat weave and yet quite different from that of
the ghileems. Note its braided appearance.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 11. Shemakha</span> (coarse).&mdash;Back of the same rug as
shown in No. 10. Note the quantity of loose yarn ends.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">No. 12. Shemakha</span> (fine).&mdash;Ten stitches to the inch. Note
the difference in the number of loose yarn ends in this piece
compared with those in the coarsely woven fabrics (No. 11).</span></p>

Turkish rugs have narrow webs, with the exception of the Karaman, the
Ladik and the Bergama, which have wide ones. (9) As a rule the
Caucasians have narrow webs, and the Turkoman have wide ones. (10) The

<h2>GENERAL CLASSIFICATION</h2>


<p>In the general market are found over fifty
different kinds of rugs, most of which are named
after the towns or districts in which they are
made, from which they are marketed, or after the
people who make them. There is generally also
some slight difference in the weave, the material,
the color, the design or the finish, which gives
each class its distinguishing, technical character.
Of late years, however, there has been such an
intermingling of races and transmission of ideas
from one country to another, that even the expert
is often unable to identify a rug with the place in
which it was made.</p>

<p>There is occasionally a dealer who has many
of his own names which he uses to the extinction
of all others and some of the names used in
Western countries would not be recognized in the
countries from which the rugs come. Under such
circumstances classification becomes rather difficult
and it is not to be wondered at that authorities
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg. 162]</a></span>
sometimes disagree. Importers and dealers
in Oriental rugs would find it greatly to their
advantage if they had a strict rug nomenclature
based on facts and if they discountenanced everything
in the trade which tended towards charlatanism
or inspired distrust in the minds of buyers.</p>

<p>In the classification to follow we will consider
rugs from a geographical stand-point.</p>

<p>To begin, we will consider them in the following
order: 1st, Persian; 2nd, Turkish; 3rd, Caucasian;
4th, Turkoman; 5th, Beluchistan; and
6th, Chinese.</p>

<p class="pmb3">No reference will be made to Indian rugs for
the reason that, outside of the fact that they are
made in India, they can nowadays hardly claim
a right to be classed as Oriental products, inasmuch
as they are wholly modern creations made
merely upon a trade basis, often by machinery,
and after designs furnished by American and
European designers.</p>

Niris.<br />
<br />
(k) Named after the city of Herat, which is not situated in
Khorasan at all, but is across the Persian border in
Afghanistan. They take this name for two reasons:
first, because they are woven by people who formerly
lived in Herat, but who, owing to political disturbances,
settled in Khorasan; and second, because they are marketed
at Herat.<br />

      There is a central pole medallion within another medallion. The

      and dark blue, white and yellow, especially the latter. The outside
      medallion has an old ivory background and is strewn with beautiful
      undulating vines covered with flowers of various colors, those at one
      end being principally in old rose while at the other end a rich red
      seems to predominate. Each corner of the field outside of the medallion
      has a rich blue background with scroll figures and large
      flowers, differing considerably in color at the two ends. There are
      four border strips, the outside one being of plain ivory. The main
      border consists of alternate white and old rose floral forms connected
      by a meandering line upon a dark blue background and on both

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PERSIAN CLASSIFICATION
AND DESCRIPTION<a id="G_Persian_classif"></a></h2>
</div>


<p>From the earliest time to the present the Persian
has excelled all others in the designing of
flowers and in color decoration, therefore the
Persian textiles have always shown complex
floral designs and harmonious arrangement of
colors. Unlike the Turkish fabrics, they almost
invariably have a full straight fringe at each end
which is composed of loose warp threads.</p>

<p>In Persia both the Senna and the Ghiordes
knots are used, and the latter has been adopted
in some localities where the former alone was
once in vogue.</p>

<p>The weavers of Persia are usually composed
of women and children of both sexes. The latter,
however, do not take up the work at nearly so
early an age as they do in Asia Minor. In Persia
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg. 170]</a></span>
they seldom begin earlier than ten years of age,
while in Asia Minor thousands of little children
from four to six years of age may be seen working
at the loom. The usual pay in Persia is
fifteen tomans ($0.91) a year for the first two
years of their apprenticeship. This amounts to
about $13.65 of our money. After the expiration
of two years they are paid at the rate of one
toman for every 30,000 stitches.</p>

<p>The Persian government has endeavored to
uphold the quality of its rugs in the face of
demoralizing influences, but alas, Persia too is getting
the commercial spirit and aniline dyes are
being smuggled into and secretly used all over
the country.</p>

<p>One correspondent in Teheran says, "Good
rugs are hard to get and are very expensive.
There are quantities of the commercial variety,
but those can be bought in London as cheap as in
Persia." During the recent revolution quite a
number of the palaces were sold out by their
owners at auction. At these sales the good rugs
were quickly picked up at fabulous prices by
European residents in Teheran.</p>

<p class="pmb3">There are no rug factories in Persia, but there
are several establishments owned by foreigners,
especially at Sultanabad and Tabriz, where the
wool is dyed and given out to the weavers to take
home and weave according to the designs and
specifications furnished.</p>

<h3>PERSIAN RUG PROVINCES</h3>

<p>The following is a short description of the
various Persian provinces from which rugs come:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Azerbijan</span> is the most northeastern province
of Persia. It includes a part of Ancient Armenia
and its present population consists mostly of
Turks, with some Armenians and Kurds. Tabriz
is the capital. Its present output of rugs is very
large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardelan</span> is the province just south of Azerbijan.
Its inhabitants are mostly Kurds and its
capital is Kermanshah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irak Ajemi</span> is the largest province of Persia.
It practically occupies the centre of the country.
Its principal city is Teheran, which is the present
capital of Persia. Irak Ajemi has a larger output
of rugs than any other province of Persia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farsistan</span> or <span class="smcap">Fars</span>, as it is sometimes called,
lies in the southern part of Persia west of Kirman
and south of Irak Ajemi. Shiraz is its capital and
it produces a wool which is not excelled, if
equalled, by that of any other country in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg. 172]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Khorasan</span> is Persia's most southeastern province
and, next to Irak Ajemi, its largest one. It
is sometimes called "The Land of the Sun," and
is inhabited by Arabs, Turkomans, Kurds, Afghans,
Baluches, and Jews. The western portion is a
desert. Meshed is the capital. It is one of the
last of the Persian provinces to be affected by
outside influences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirman</span> is the most southerly province of
Persia and the least known. Being so difficult of
access, it is seldom visited by the traveller; consequently
its products are free from outside influence.
It has for its capital the city of the same
name.</p>

Persian class is given in the following pages.</p>

<h4>HEREZ</h4>

<p class="pmb1">A name applied to all carpets made in the mountainous
district of Herez and to some from Tabriz
and Sultanabad. The different products of this
class are so similar in many respects that it is
often difficult and sometimes impossible for the
expert to differentiate. There is a great prevalence
of Mongolian influence in their designs.
Until quite recently the Herez district was one of
the few districts from which the modern rugs
were a decided improvement on the antique, but
they have deteriorated considerably of late. They
are marketed at Tabriz.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">In exception to most of the Herez weaves this piece has no
medallion centre with corner pieces to match, but the style of
the floral motifs which fill the field is somewhat characteristic
of the region in Northern Persia where it is made. The Herez
products are extremely serviceable.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>BAKHSHIS</h4>

a background of green and from one to four
narrow border stripes on each side of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Green usually forms the

figures are red, blue, green, pink, yellow and white.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">The main border stripe carries eight-petaled flowers of
various colors, connected by the fish-bone motif upon a ground
of white. On either side of this is a flower and vine design in
various colors, the inner one on a ground of old rose and the
outer one on a ground of dark brown. The inner and outer
border stripes carry the reciprocal saw-teeth; the former in
blue and red and the latter in green and red.</span></p>

brown prevails with soft delicate reds, pinks,
blues, and greens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Of the best in the antiques, but generally
poor in the modern fabrics.</p>

<h4>ISPAHAN</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonym.</span>&mdash;Isfayan. Sometimes, like the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg. 195]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From three to five border stripes,
usually three, one wide one between two narrow

wine red, and green, especially in those made in
the 16th century. The Herati design was frequently
employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Deep reds, blues, and
greens. Beautiful crimson. Deep wine colors
known as Ispahan red. Field generally of deep
red or blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;The best.</p>

animal decoration of the finest Persian type.
Large palmette and rich floral patterns connected
by vines and serrated leaves arranged similarly to
the Herati pattern. Cypress cones and various
tree forms. The Shah Abbas design was freely
employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;Generally long and narrow (runners).
Seldom small.</p>

Fragments have sold in recent years for $300 to
$1000, and many carpets have brought from
$15,000 to $25,000.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;Extremely rare. Almost impossible
to secure a genuine specimen. The Saruks
are the Ispahans of the present day. The antiques
are examples of the most perfect weaving skill.
Many of the so-called Ispahans of the 16th and
17th centuries were really productions of Herat.</p>

Persian carpets. They resemble somewhat the
Saraband. Not very common in the United States.</p>


<h4>SARABAND</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonyms.</span>&mdash;Serebend, Sarawan. The finest
ones are sometimes called Mir Saraband and the
coarsest ones are frequently called Selvile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;A corruption of the word
Sarawan, which is the name of a mountainous
district south of Feraghan, where they are made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;One end usually has a narrow web and
short fringe of loose warp threads, while the

turned over and hemmed. Frequently
several strands of colored wool run through the
web, as in the Kurdish productions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;Usually from four to twelve border
stripes, the principal one of which is from three
to four inches wide with an ivory white background
and a vine design running through it, at
each turn of which is a leaf similar in shape to
that in the Herati pattern. The vine design is
nearly always present and characterizes the Saraband
border from all others. The smaller border
stripes are generally filled by various well-known
designs, such as the reciprocal trefoil, the barber-pole
stripe, the Greek meander, etc.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;The field is generally of
a dark blue or a rich red. In antiques it is often of
a pink or rose shade. The main border stripe is
frequently of old ivory or red, while the other
border stripes vary, most of them as a rule being
the same color as that which predominates in the
field.</p>

the same direction. The Mir Saraband sometimes

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A checked selvage at each end with a
short fringe of warp, like the Shiraz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;Generally from three to five border
stripes, some of which are quite elaborate. The
barber-pole stripe is commonly used, but generally
consists of several colors instead of only two as

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The pear pattern is commonly employed
and when used it suggests the crown jewel,
being an assemblage of points rather than of
lines and more minutely worked out than are the
smaller forms so common to the Saraband. No
regularity of design, but quite similar to the
Shiraz. Often a pronounced striped effect. Alternating
rows of geometrical and floral designs.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">The field carries an unusual double arrangement of the pear
motif, alternating with small tree forms. The outside border
consists of small bird forms, each alternate row facing in the
opposite direction. Note the elaborate webbing at each end.
(See also page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>.) Prayer rugs of this class are exceedingly
rare, in fact they are seldom seen in this country. This one
is a gem, but has lost its principal Shiraz character in that the
sides have been reovercast with wool of one color instead of
with two or more colors, as it originally was. Another very
unusual feature is the absence of two of the border stripes on
the lower end. (See also color plate at page <a href="#Page_52">52</a> and doubletone at

seven to eight feet and occasionally in carpet
sizes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;Usually from $0.75 to $3.00 per
square foot. The prayer rugs are rare and expensive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TURKISH CLASSIFICATION<a id="G_Turkish_classif"></a></h2>
</div>


<p>The term "Turkey" includes all portions of
Asia Minor, the principal rug-weaving districts
of which are Anatolia and Kurdistan.</p>

<p>The annual importations of rugs into the
United States alone from Asia Minor amount to
from $2,500,000 to $3,000,000, most of which are
shipped directly from Constantinople. In many
parts of Asia Minor, especially in Oushak,
Smyrna, Ghiordes, Kulah, and Sivas, nearly every
home has a loom, some two or three, and in many
places factories have been established by European
and American capitalists; the weavers are
almost all Armenian women and children, the
latter ranging from four to thirteen years of age.
Moslem women and children will not work in factories.
As a rule these people earn barely enough
to clothe and feed themselves, but those who have
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg. 218]</a></span>
been able to lay by anything generally invest their
earnings in carpets, as people of other countries
often do in diamonds and precious stones, handing
them down from generation to generation and
selling one when hard pressed for money, so that
the tourist is often surprised to find in the homes
a collection of very valuable rugs.</p>

<p>The Ghiordes knot is used exclusively and
both warp and woof are always of wool or goats'
hair. Fully four-fifths of the present output are
aniline dyed. The weave is coarser and the nap
longer than in the Persian class and many of
them are crooked.</p>

<p>The designs, which vary little, are more geometrical
than are those of the Caucasians. The
Turks never weave figures of birds, animals and
human beings, as their religion forbids it. Those
with a cross are always Armenian, as the Turks do
not decorate with the cross, while those with the
prayer niche are always Turkish, as the Armenians
never pray on their rugs. Green, the sacred
color of the Mohammedans, is seldom used except
in the prayer rugs or those designed for mosques.
Most of the large Turkish carpets are modern and
are made near Smyrna. Many of the modern fabrics
bear no relation to antiques of the same name.</p>

<p>The southern part of Armenia is called Kurdistan.
It is inhabited by wandering, warlike
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg. 219]</a></span>
tribes of Nomads, who pasture their flocks in the
southern plains in the winter and go to the mountain
districts in the summer time.</p>

<p>The Kurds possess the skill of shading their
colors, but this they have abandoned of late. They
also scatter small bits of color through a space
otherwise unoccupied. Red is their favorite color.</p>

<p class="pmb3">On the following pages is given a detailed description
of the various Turkish rugs.</p>

the different colored yarns which are used in the
body of the rug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From five to eight border stripes,
most frequently five, the main stripe carrying
the most pretentious form of ornamentation.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes knot, 7 horizontal by 10
vertical. An unusual specimen of Kir Shehr in prayer design,
marked by a radical departure from the accepted type of
prayer arch formation peculiar to this weave. The flatness of
the arch and the multiplicity of borders and stripes suggest
Kula influence. The outer border, on ivory, has a conventionalized
floral design, green, yellow and pale blue flower devices
on waving vine tracery. Two medium stripes in different red
values enclose the second border, which carries the S device
in lavender and blue on black. The inner border displays the
carnation in blue, lavender and red on canary. The prayer
field is flat and non-serrate at top, border outlined in an ancient
Kir Shehr motif in red and ash white on light blue. About the
mihrab is an arrangement of carnations, while the top of arch
and on outer side of field are more pinks and a small shrub
device. The field is in shades of rose, the softened end result
of an original magenta, and carries three plateaus superposed,
each sustaining four trees; two bearing fruits outlined against
soft green foliage, and the other two, coniferÃ¦. Between each
outer pair of trees is a little temple. Above and below in the
field are curious devices evidently picturing some presumably
sacred edifice. This rug bears evidence of age and use, while
the chromatic ensemble is soft and refined. Technically, it has
a two strand yellow selvage; two red wool weft threads between
each row of knots, and a two strand cream wool warp. Both
ends are finished with a short, light brown web and plain,
long fringe.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Siegel Rug.</span>&mdash;This piece is similar to one exhibited in
the Berlin museum under the name of Kir Shehr, although it
has some characteristics of other Anatolian products, such as
the Kulah, the Konieh and the Meles. Having only the photograph
to assist us in the classification, we are obliged to accept
that of the Berlin connoisseur.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Stanton Rug</span> (page <a href="#Page_130">130</a>).&mdash;The small border stripes in this
piece are Kulah in character, while the main stripe is found
more or less in all the Anatolian products, especially the
Ghiordes.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>OUSHAK</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the city of Oushak,
one of the greatest rug markets of Asia Minor, on
account of its railroad connection with the Mediterranean
seaboard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Whom Made.</span>&mdash;Mostly by Greek Mohammedans
who reside in the vicinity of Oushak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically four to
eight; number horizontally four to ten; number
to square inch sixteen to eighty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Wool of the same grade as that in the
pile. It is generally dyed the predominating color
of the rug.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Wool, same as that used for the warp
and pile, and it also is dyed.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Maj. L. B. Lawton's Description.</span>&mdash;A most unique and rare
specimen of an obscure Anatolian weave. Good Koniehs are quite
as scarce as good Kulahs or Ghiordes, are less known and have
therefore less demand. The right and left Rhodian lilies are
green, the centre one is azure&mdash;all on rose pink. The space
above shades from Nile green to sea green. Main border is
golden buff. This old rug is as thick as a Kazak. For softness
of tone it rivals the most delicate silk rug.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Mercer Rug</span> (page <a href="#Page_138">138</a>).&mdash;This is a rug of considerable age,
and a very fine specimen of its kind. The center is in soft
tints of undyed wool, while the peacock blues of the field above
the niche are almost metallic in their brilliancy and lustre.
The delicate form of the Rhodian lily is used with much nicety
of feeling throughout the border and to break the mass of the
centre. (Owner's description.)</span></p>

<h4>MUJUR</h4>

in square or diamond shaped medallions. The
reciprocal saw teeth design is frequently
employed.</p>

cross panel above the prayer niche and the field is,
as a rule, filled with designs.</p>

by four to seven long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg. 228]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;This rug comes from the town of
Maden, in the Kir Shehr district of Konieh province. Mudjar,
a better known rug producing town, is within twenty miles.
It has the remarkable wool and dye qualities that make the
production of Kir Shehr. This rug is so very bright that
the assertion that it is fifty to seventy-five years old might
be disputed, but the unequal color erosion, the remarkable bald
shine of the back, and the well marked thinning of the pile
where the knees of the devotee rested while at his devotion, evidence
its antiquity. The panel of lavender above the prayer
arch is notable, as is the pigeon blood ruby of the field. While
this rug has evidently done duty for many years, it was probably
folded away after use at prayer, and given little exposure
to sunlight.</span></p>

<h4>LADIK</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;A corruption of the word

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;In the antiques the finest, selected,
lustrous wool, which is generally cut short. In
the moderns a coarse wool of loose texture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Antiques closely and evenly woven.
Moderns loosely woven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;A fairly wide colored selvage, made by
weaving the woof threads upon three or four of
the outside warp threads. Sometimes the selvage
is added.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Usually a two-or three-inch red web
at each end, which is frequently striped with
yellow or blue. A fringe formed by the loose
warp ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From three to five border stripes,
generally three, one wide one with a narrow one
on each side. The main border stripe in many of
the oldest specimens has the Rhodian lily design
alternating with the rosette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Subdued rich colors.
Usually greens, reds, blues, and yellows, with
more or less old ivory or white. Magenta is very
frequently employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg. 230]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;Prayer design most frequent. The
pattern is so characteristic as to be unmistakable.
Figures are usually bold and large in comparison
to the size of the rug. The prayer niche always
contains five tree-like branches alternately capped
with a floral and a geometrical design. A mosque
lamp usually hangs from the niche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;Prayer rug sizes and mats similar to
the so-called "Anatolian" mats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;From $1.75 to $3.50 per square foot.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;Not many modern ones. They
somewhat resemble the Bergama, but are somewhat
brighter and heavier.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Maj. L. B. Lawton's Description.</span>&mdash;Choice antique Ladiks
are considerably rarer than either Kulahs or Ghiordes. Many
collectors owning all other Anatolians have never seen a Ladik.
This weave almost invariably shows the Rhodian lilies both
above and below the niche. The specimen here shown has a
rich red field doubly hooked with gold; spaces above and below
are gentian blue, main border is yellow. This latter color has
until recently been in disfavor with American collectors; but the
French and German critics have always shown a great liking for
yellow, and it is now coming into its own in America.</span></p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Maj. L. B. Lawton's Description.</span>&mdash;A typical specimen,
showing double and single latch hooks in the niche. The eight
borders might cause a beginner to name the rug Kulah, except for
the reason that Kulahs are paler in tone and usually much
larger, and decidedly thinner. A good Ak Hissar is intrinsically
worth as much as a Kulah of same quality, but, being less rare,
may be had for about ten per centum of the cost of a Kulah.
This Ak Hissar is a study in rose and green; the niche is rose,
the oblong field is green; inside border is canary, next is black;
other borders alternate rose and ivory. The pattern above the
niche is a Ghiordes conceit, as is the main border.</span></p>

<h4>ANATOLIAN PROPER</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonym.</span>&mdash;Yesteklik, a name frequently
applied to the mats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the country of Anatolia,
which is another name for Asia Minor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where Made.</span>&mdash;Most of them come from the
province of Angora and Konieh. The so-called
Anatolian mats come from all parts of Anatolia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Always Ghiordes. Number vertically
six to fifteen; number horizontally six to ten;
number to square inch thirty-six to one hundred
fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Always wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Always wool, which is usually dyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Usually a long, shaggy, soft wool.
Sometimes mohair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Very good as a rule, but apt to be
somewhat irregular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Always selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Nearly always a wide red webbing with
loose warp threads at each end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From one to six border stripes, most

<h4>BERGAMA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonyms.</span>&mdash;Bergamo, Pergamo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;A corruption of the word
Pergamo, which is the name of a small village of
3000 inhabitants, about forty miles northeast of
Smyrna, where they are made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically ten to
fourteen; number horizontally six to twelve; number

quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg. 236]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Always dyed wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;The best soft, silky wool, usually quite
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Frequently several woof threads
between each row of knots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Usually broad red selvaged sides,
made by weaving the woof threads upon three or
four outside warp threads. Frequently have
small tassels of wool along the sides. The only
rug that has these excepting the Shiraz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Rather broad web with braided fringe
at each end. The web often carries a woven
design or blue stripes. Until recently the Bergama
was the only rug which sometimes had
rosettes woven on the webbing. Nowadays an
occasional Anatolian may be found with this
feature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From three to five border stripes,
usually three. They are generally wide with flowers
in profile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Red, green, blue, yellow,
ivory, and orange. Rather dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Nearly always of the best.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The Bergama designs are somewhat
characteristic. The Bergama weavers are inventors
of patterns rather than copyists. Medallions
frequent, with a well covered field. Sometimes
the checker-board pattern. Figures generally
bold and large in proportion to size of the rug.</p>

variety of nameless geometrical designs in red, yellow, blue,
brown and drab upon a white background. The outer border

motif which might have been intended for the wine glass, so
frequently found in the Caucasian fabrics.</span></p>

in which is a most symmetrical and formal arrangement of a leaf
worked in light green, brown and red. The outer and inner border
stripes carry the Ghiordes "Tarantula" design, and in the main

stripes, having as a rule more than any other class
of rugs. Usually one wide stripe with a multiplication
of peculiarly marked small ones, which
alternate in colors and carry minute designs. A
distinguishing feature is the so-called "Kulah"
border stripe, which consists of the repetition of
a figure which somewhat resembles an alligator
and is quite Chinese in character.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;In the antiques, red,

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The great majority of the Kulah
rugs are of the prayer variety. The inner field
is frequently filled, or partly filled, with small
floral patterns. A figure resembling the Shamrock
is quite common. Usually one panel above
the prayer field, whereas the Ghiordes generally
has two panels: one above and one below the
prayer field.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;So similar to the Ghiordes that it
is sometimes difficult to differentiate. Of the
modern ones the better grades are made by the
Christians, while the poorer grades are made by
the Mohammedans. The distinguishing features
of the Kulah are first its characteristic border
stripes, second the filled or partly filled centre
field, while in the Ghiordes the centre field is generally
of a solid color, and third, the single panel,
while the Ghiordes generally has two panels.</p>

blue, and the flower forms that rest upon it are of soft canary and
azure. Seven borders alternately of tan and blue surround the field
and carry the "fleck" design commonly found in borders of this
style. Occasional touches of blood red are also distinctive features
of these Kulah fabrics.</span></p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;This rug comes from a city of
great antiquity in Southwestern Asia Minor, near the coast,
opposite the island of Rhodes.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">The design and coloring are archaic in simplicity and suggest
the interests of a people dwelling by the sea. Observe the
turtle figures interspersed between the curves of vine in the
panels; also the fin-like appearance of the leaf-forms attached
to the vine, the line of fish-hook heads bordering the panels
and wave design on either side of same. The striped character
of the field is a feature to be noted in this rug, also the
introduction of an exceptional design in the fourth stripe.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg. 244]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor">The border is seen to be very inconspicuous and of
remarkably few stripes for a product of the Anatolian country. The simple
nature of the small detached floral forms indicates an early origin, before
the enriching influence of the Persian invasion.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">Brilliant colors were chosen for use in the rug, though of
such mellow tone as to be in excellent, subdued harmony. The
predominating colors are golden canary-yellow, madder red, and
green, with blue, violet and white as secondary tones.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">The shades in which these colors appear are quite indescribable,
doubtless on account of careless methods of dyeing or
the chances of home-made mixtures. Thus the green is of a
bluish cast, the blue is mottled with lighter shades (a well-known
characteristic of this variety of rug) and the violet, which,
as the most typical and exclusive of Meles colors, should be pure
in tone, is of dingy look, apparently having succeeded brown in
the dye-pot.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">All the colors have remained absolutely fast, despite the
long exposure of time. The kaleidoscopic effect which has been
noted as a quality in many old Meles rug patterns, may be
easily detected in this specimen.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Stanton Rug.</span>&mdash;A much finer weave than the average
rug of this class and a very attractive design. Note the
peculiar shape of the field which is notched in instead of out, as
in the majority of hearth rugs. The yellow and the plum colors
in the main border stripe are seldom found in any other class
of rugs.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the Gulf of Makri.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where Made.</span>&mdash;On the islands in the Gulf of
Makri and in the towns along its coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Always the Ghiordes. Number vertically
four to eight; number horizontally four to
eight; number to the square inch sixteen to sixty-four.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Quite similar to that of the Meles,
but a trifle coarser.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;White or gray wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;White or gray wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Of long wool, usually from 3/8 to 3/4 of
an inch long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Usually finished with a three or four
corded selvage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A wide web through which generally
run blue and red stripes with or without a knotted
mesh and loose warp ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borders.</span>&mdash;Usually three stripes, the designs
of which are, as a rule, less floral in character
than are those of the Meles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Quite similar to those
employed in the Meles, especially the yellows,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg. 246]</a></span>
reds, blues and plum color. Unlike the Meles,
they usually carry green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;A sort of a mixture of the Meles
and Caucasian designs. The field is most frequently
composed of two or three panels which
very much resemble those of cathedral windows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;From three and a half to four and a
half feet wide by five to seven feet long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;As they are seldom found in the
market it is difficult to place any stated value on
them.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;One of the rarest rugs in existence.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">The weave, the tawny yellow and the motives in the right
hand panel are typically Meles; the motives in the left hand
panel are more like those found in the Bergama products; and
the cross panel at the upper end of the field is a Kulah or
Ghiordes feature. The wide web at either end with the varicolored
stripes is a feature quite foreign to the Anatolian
products.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>SMYRNA</h4>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;Because they are marketed
at Smyrna. Smyrna itself is not a centre of rug
weaving, but these rugs come from the towns of
the western provinces of Turkey in Asia, namely,
Aidin and Brousa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Corded edges overcast with dark wool.
Frequently overcast with wool of different colors
after the Kurdish fashion. Occasionally selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;At each end a narrow selvage with one
or more stripes of colored yarn running through,
usually red and blue. As a rule one of these
selvages is turned over and hemmed, while the
other is finished with braided warp threads which
are knotted at the ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From three to six border stripes,
usually three, which are separated by lines of
dark blue or brown. Frequently there is considerable
camels' hair in the border. The Saraband
pattern is sometimes copied.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Usually dark, rich blues,
yellows, greens, reds, and browns. The browns
and yellows predominate as a rule. These colors
are shaded as only the Kurds know how.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;This type of rug comes from the
largest rug-producing centre of Eastern Asia Minor. The specimen
shown illustrates the Mosul at its best, as to closeness of
weave, length of pile, symmetry of design and richness of
coloring.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">The superb lustre of the wool, comparable only to a silk
plush, and the great softness of the long pile&mdash;features which
have made famous the rugs from this region&mdash;are here conspicuous.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">In shape and design also the specimen is typical. The
field is composed of diamond-shaped sections outlined in black
and decorated with the conventionalized tarantula. By placing
these sections diagonally a latticed effect is produced.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg. 250]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The usual border plan of three stripes, two narrow ones
separated by a broader, appears here. The narrow stripes are
in the familiar flower-and-vine design, the broad stripe in a
formal arrangement of rosette and hour-glass, all conforming to
the geometrical and rectangular lines of Turkish design.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The color scheme of the piece is remarkable for its harmony.
The dominant color is wine, introduced in many beautifully
blended shades, and relieved with correspondingly soft
tones of old blue and green, the whole illuminated with well-arranged
bands of white.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CAUCASIAN CLASSIFICATION<a id="G_Caucasian_classif"></a></h2>
</div>


<p>Caucasia and Transcaucasia form an isthmus
connecting Europe and Asia. It is bounded on
the west by the Black Sea and on the east by the
Caspian Sea and it has an area of about 166,500
square miles, with a population of nearly ten million.
It was once Persian territory, but was acquired
by Russia in 1813. Nowhere in the world
is there such a mixture of races and languages,
the number of dialects being estimated at about
seventy. The carpets of the Caucasians are in
coloring and in design identical with those of
Ancient Assyria and Babylon and they have preserved
their original characteristics, but alas, not
their original dyes, for here too the coal-tar products
have been well received by these wild mountaineers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg. 254]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">The Caucasian rugs are characterized by their
prominent borders and their purely geometrical
patterns with sharp outlines. Both warp and
woof are usually of wool excepting in some of the
Kabistans and Shirvans and, as a rule, the ends
are finished with loose or braided warp threads.
The predominating colors are the blues and yellows.
They are seldom made in large sizes. Some
of the most characteristic designs are the eight-pointed
star of the Medes, the six-pointed star of
the Mohammedans, the triangle, the diamond, the
latch hook, the barber-pole stripe, the tarantula,
the swastika, the reciprocal trefoil, the link-in-lozenge
and the tree of life.</p>


<h4>DAGHESTAN</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;Daghestan means "mountain
land" and is the name of a district in Caucasian
Russia on the Caspian Sea. It has a population
of 600,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically ten to
fifteen; number horizontally eight to fourteen;
number to square inch eighty to two hundred ten.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Usually wool, being as a rule a dark
brown or natural color in the antiques and white
or gray in the moderns. Some of the moderns
have a combination of cotton and wool. The warp
threads may be composed of one strand of cotton
and one of wool in such a way as to cause a puckering
of the fabric, especially after it has been
wet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;In the moderns nearly always cotton.
In the antiques usually white or gray wool or a
mixture of the two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Fine silky wool cut short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;As a rule finely and closely woven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Selvaged or overcast with colored
wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A narrow selvage with loose or knotted
warp threads at each end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;Three or more border stripes,
usually three, carrying small figures and separated
by narrow stripes of solid colors. The main
border stripe most frequently has a cream colored
ground. The lobster, the crab, the reciprocal trefoil,
the reciprocal saw-teeth, the wine glass,
the barber-pole stripe, and the Georgian border
designs are frequently employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;The central ground is
usually ivory with figures in the different tints of
red, blue, green, and yellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;In the antiques all good. Some of the
moderns are aniline dyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The same patterns are employed as
were in vogue centuries ago. Diagonal ornamentation
of both border and field is frequently employed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg. 256]</a></span>
as in many of the Kabistans. Floral forms
seldom used. The centre is never plain, but is
always filled with small geometrical figures. The
tarantula, the swastika, the link, S forms, octagon,
eight-pointed star, and the latch hook variations
are common. The Greek cross is almost omnipresent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;From two and one-half to seven by
four to ten feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;Antiques rare; moderns cheap, from
$1.00 to $3.00 per square foot.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">REmarks.</span>&mdash;Frequently crooked. The Shirvan
and Kabistans are often sold as Daghestans.</p>

<h4>BAKU</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the city of Baku, a
seaport on the Caspian in the district of Shirvan,
from whence they are shipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg. 262]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically eight to
sixteen; number horizontally eight to twelve;
number to square inch sixty-four to one hundred
ninety-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Cotton or wool. Frequently camels'
hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Usually cotton. Sometimes wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Wool with more or less camels' or
goats' hair, cut short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Generally closely woven and well tied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Usually overcast, occasionally selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A small streak of camels' hair is
usually thrown across one end. This is one of
the characteristic Baku features.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From three to six border stripes,
most frequently three, one wide one with a narrow
one on either side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Similar to those of the
Daghestan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Generally good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The large-sized pear pattern is perhaps
the most common. It is generally of a rectilineal
nature. Frequently there is a central
medallion with corners to match.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;From three to seven by four to nine

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">The design of this piece, the large pear motif with central
serrated medallion and corner pieces to match, is the most
common one employed in the Baku district. In contrast to the
Persian rendition of the pear design those in the Baku are
larger and more rectilineal. Like the Saraband the stems point
in the opposite direction in alternate rows. All of the border
stripes are purely Caucasian, the central one being a form of
latch hook border.</span></p>

<h4>SHEMAKHA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonyms.</span>&mdash;Soumak, Sumak, Kashmir, Cashmere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the city of Shemakha,
the capital and principal commercial city of the
ancient Khanate of Shirvan, which was ceded to
Persia in 1813. Soumak is a corruption of the
word Shemakha. Sometimes called Kashmir or
Cashmere on account of the resemblance of the
weave to that of the Cashmere shawl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Whom Made.</span>&mdash;By the Nomadic tribes of
Shirvan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stitches.</span>&mdash;In antiques ten to twelve rows of
stitches to the inch. In moderns seven is the
average.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Always wool. Usually white in the
antiques and coarse grayish brown in the moderns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg. 264]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Always wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Woven in the same primitive fashion
as of old. The only pileless Oriental rug besides
the Ghileems. The different colored woof threads
are twisted over and under the warp threads by
means of a needle in such a way that each stitch
is made diagonally, taking in two of the warp
threads and leaving every alternate row of
stitches to face in the opposite direction after the
herring-bone pattern. On the under side the
shaggy ends of the colored woof threads are left
loose. They never have any lustre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Usually overcast in dark wool, sometimes
selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A long fringe at both ends formed by
the loose warp ends. Usually white in the
antiques and grayish brown in the moderns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From two to five border stripes,
usually four, the main one carrying a zigzag
design. The Georgian border design is common,
as is also the Chinese fret.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Light and dark blue,
green, yellow, red, orange, black, and white. The
field is most frequently of dark blue or red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Good in antiques and poor in moderns.</p>

<p class="pmb3" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg. 265]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;Similar to those of the Daghestan
and Shirvan and have remained unchanged for
centuries. All designs are outlined in black and
the Mongolian influence is quite perceptible, the
knot of destiny, mountains, etc., being very
frequently used, together with the usual Caucasian
designs such as the latch hook, octagon,
and various other geometrical devices. Animals
are frequently portrayed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;From three to seven by four to twelve
feet. Seldom larger than seven by ten. Antiques
were not made in carpet sizes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;From $0.75 to $1.75 per square foot.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;Durable, but they lack animation
compared with other rugs.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">Unlike other classes, the Shemakha has no pile but has a
flat stitch made by winding the dyed woof thread around the
warp yarn. This piece is one of the finest, having thirteen
stitches to the inch. Like in most rugs of its class, the designs
are typically Caucasian, among which are freely interspersed
plenty of eight-pointed stars, swastikas and knots of destiny.
The latter motif is nearly always present in this variety.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>SHIRVAN</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the district of Shirvan,
south of Daghestan and extending from the Caspian
Sea to the river Kur. Marketed at Baku,
the trade centre of the district.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Whom Made.</span>&mdash;Woven by the Lesgie tribes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically six to
twelve; number horizontally five to nine; number
to square inch thirty to one hundred eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Generally white or gray wool or a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg. 266]</a></span>
mixture of the two in the antiques, while the moderns
are of brown or white wool or a mixture of the
two. Sometimes the warp is of cotton or goats' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Usually wool in the antiques. In modern
pieces, usually of wool, occasionally of cotton
and sometimes cotton and wool strands will be
twisted together in such a manner as to cause
more or less puckering of the fabric, especially
after same has been wet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Wool, cut short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave</span>.&mdash;Cheaply and roughly woven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Overcast or selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Usually both ends are finished alike
with a short web and an extra large fringe of
loose or knotted warp threads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;Three to five border stripes, generally
four, one wide one and several narrow ones.
As a rule they carry small designs either of a
Caucasian or Persian character. The latch hook,
the tarantula, the scorpion, and the wine glass
designs are common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Quiet tints of red, blue,
yellow, and salmon, with considerable white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Moderns very apt to be chemical.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;Quite similar to those of the Daghestan
and Kabistan, but more inclined to imitate
the Persian designs without the connecting vine or
meander effect and inclined to be rather large in
proportion to the size of the rug. The tarantula,
the swastika, the link, the S form, and the palace
patterns are commonly employed.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;Unusually fine for Shirvan. This
rug is in the century class. The three borders are not often
seen, but are characteristic of the older rugs of the Daghestan
district. The glory of this rug is in the marvelous centre. At
first sight one might think of the famous "rose" Kirmans.
The treatment of the roses, lilies, peonies, etc., merit more than
a passing glance. No weaver could possibly show greater fidelity
to nature in the shading of leaf and petal than did the now forgotten
factor of this unusual rug. The erosion of time has
given the surface an appearance of brocade velvet. Casual
examination would indicate a green background, but in reality
it is black, the profusion of green being an intricate and realistic
arrangement of leaves.</span></p></blockquote>

ancient name of Elizabethpol, from whence they
came. Others insist they should be called Genghis,
which is the name of the tribe of Nomads living
in the vicinity of Elizabethpol who weave them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Ghiordes. Number vertically six to
ten; number horizontally five to eight; number to

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Usually rather long wool or goats' hair.
Of a much finer quality in the antiques.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;As a rule coarsely woven.</p>

      niche resembles very closely that of the Meles. The designs are
      unlike those used in the other Turkoman products and the color
      combination is quite pleasing. This piece is evidently of some age

<h2>THE TURKOMAN CLASSIFICATION<a id="G_Turkoman_classif"></a></h2>


<p>The territory from which the so-called "Turkoman"
rugs come is that part of Central Asia
consisting of Turkestan, Eastern Turkestan and
Russian Turkestan lying north of Persia and
Afghanistan and west of the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It comprises thousands upon thousands of
square miles and is inhabited by numerous rug-making
tribes of Nomads. The distinguishing
marks of the Turkoman products are their wide
web, their octagon and medallion designs and
their old traditional colors of predominating red
with patches of white, brown, and green. The
dyes are usually fast and the knot is always
Persian with the exception of an occasional
Yomud or Samarkand, which may be tied with the
Turkish knot. The rugs of Eastern and Russian
Turkestan are really Chinese, but geographically
should be classed with the other Turkoman products.
Having been in the past less accessible they
are now found in relative abundance and are
therefore the least costly.</p>

<h4>KHIVA BOKHARA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonym.</span>&mdash;Afghan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the city of Khiva, in
the province of Bokhara, from the vicinity of
which they come. The name Afghan is sometimes
used because some of the inhabitants of northern
Afghanistan contribute to the supply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Whom Made.</span>&mdash;By the Kirzig tribe of
Nomads living in the province of Bokhara and
in Northern Afghanistan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Senna. Number vertically seven to
twelve; number horizontally six to eight; number
to square inch forty-two to ninety-six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Dark wool or goats' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Black or gray wool or goats' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Fine lustrous wool or goats' hair of
various lengths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Loosely tied so that on the back it
has the appearance of the Ghiordes knot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Usually a wide selvage of black or
dark brown goats' hair, sometimes containing as
many as seven cords.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Wide selvage at each end in plain red
or striped with blue lines. The long, shaggy
fringe of the loose goats' hair warp is a characteristic
feature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg. 279]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;From two to four narrow border
stripes, usually three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;A lavish use of the Turkoman
reds in the field with designs in blue, orange,
brown, green, and white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Good in the antiques. Nearly all of
the new pieces are chemically dyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The octagon is almost universally
employed and is quartered by alternating colors.
Animal forms are seldom seen. The prayer form
is also seldom found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;$1.25 to $2.00 per square foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;They are the largest of the Turkoman
rugs, being nearly always in carpet sizes and
almost square, six to nine by eight to eleven feet.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;One of the best inexpensive rugs on
the market. Coarser and heavier than the other
Turkoman products and in damp weather they
are liable to have more or less of the smell of
goats. The Khiva is about the only antique carpet
now on the market.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Knot</span>: Senna. Ten to the inch vertically and seven
horizontally, making seventy to the square inch; unusually close
for a rug of this class.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">This piece is of an unusually fine grade with a long nap
and beautiful colors. The field, like that of nearly all Khivas, is
filled with conventional octagon and diamond forms with a small
eight-pointed star between each.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Shortell Rug</span> (page <a href="#Page_120">120</a>).&mdash;Prayer rugs of this particular
class are extremely rare and the peculiar prayer niche in this one
is certainly most unique and unusual. Note the hands in the
two upper corners of the field. It is on these that the worshipper
is supposed to place his hands while prostrating himself in the
act of prayer.</span></p>

<h4>BESHIR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After the words "Bech

in five adjoining villages west of Khiva on the
shores of the Amour Daria River in Turkestan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borders.</span>&mdash;Few stripes and narrow in proportion
to the size of the rug. The designs are
usually Tekke in character. The reciprocal saw
teeth design is a feature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A fairly wide web which is usually
dyed red through which generally pass blue
stripes or strands of colored yarn. Knotted or
loose warp ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;The free use of yellow
is characteristic. Browns, brownish reds and blue
with very little white, as a rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;Those of the border are Tekke in

of tree motifs arranged in strips with
alternating colored background. Caucasian and
Mongol designs are commonly employed. Occasionally
the field is filled with Chinese cloud bands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;From $1.75 to $5.00 a square foot.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;One of the rarest of the Turkoman
products. Most of those brought to this country
are antiques.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Owner's Description.</span>&mdash;This rug differs from the Bokhara
commonly seen, as it has the Tree of Life pattern drawn in the
conventional form of the Bokhara weavers, but very artistically
done, the wool used being the very best, very silky, and the
selvage is finished in a very workmanlike manner. It was a
skilful weaver who made this rug and it probably was his
masterpiece. See also color plate at page <a href="#Page_274">274</a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>TEKKE BOKHARA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;Because they are made by
the Tekke Turkoman tribes of Nomads, one of
the most numerous and powerful of the Turkoman
tribes, who inhabit the country extending
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg. 282]</a></span>
to Afghanistan on the south and Khorasan on
the west.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Senna. Number vertically eight to
twenty-eight; number horizontally five to twenty-five;
number to square inch forty to four hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Splendid wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Wool, dyed red or brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Splendid soft, velvety, closely clipped
wool. Sometimes some goats' hair or silk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weave.</span>&mdash;Renowned for its close texture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Overcast in wool which is dyed the
predominating color of the rug. Occasionally
selvaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A web from ten to twelve inches in
width at each end which is colored the same as
the body of the rug. This is finished with a
fringe of loose warp ends. Sometimes there are
twisted ropes at one end, showing that it was
intended for hanging. This is especially common
in the prayer Tekke.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;One to five border stripes, usually
three.</p>

<p class="pmb3" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg. 283]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;Elongated octagon forms arranged
in rows alternating with rows of diamond forms
with straight lines connecting the centres of the
octagon, each of which is divided into four equal
parts. In the centre of each octagon is frequently
found the eight-pointed star. Sometimes the field
is covered with octagon or the diamond forms
alone without the alternate arrangement. In the
prayer rug the field is covered with little candlestick
patterns and divided into four sections by
a large cross, the arms of which carry designs
similar to those found in the border stripes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Ground usually of a rich
dark mahogany red with designs in blue, green,
orange, old rose, wine, and pink, with more or
less white or cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Usually good. Of late years some aniline
has been used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;The antiques are rather scarce and
are of good value. From $2.00 to $5.00 per square
foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;Mats to carpet size. Two to eight by
three to eighteen feet. The prayer rugs are
nearly square, from four to four and one-half by
five feet.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;Their durability is phenomenal.
The modern pieces are vastly inferior to the
antiques. The prayer rugs differ so greatly from
the others of their class that they might almost
be arranged under a separate heading, in fact
they are separately classed by some authorities
under the name of Hardjli or Princess Bokhara.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg. 284]</a></span>
The Armenians call them Khatchlie Bokhara for
the reason that the bands that divide the field
into four sections form a cross, and the word
"khatchlie" in the Armenian language means a
cross. This class of rugs is growing rapidly
scarce.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="minor">Page <a href="#Page_284">284</a>. This is the prayer Tekke, the so-called Hardjli,
Khatchlie or Princess Bokhara. The Greek cross divides the field
into quarters, each one of which is filled with rows of candle sticks.
The niche, the "Tekke border design" and the "Indian fish
bone" are here employed as in most prayer rugs of the class.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">Page <a href="#Page_282">282</a>. In design this piece is quite characteristic of its class.
The octagon is invariably present, sometimes alone, sometimes in an
alternate arrangement with diamond forms or with smaller octagons
as in this example. Here the smaller octagons only are quartered.
The peculiar arrangement of the "fish bone" design, the wide web
and the loose warp threads at each end are also characteristic features.</span></p>

<p><span class="minor">Page <a href="#Page_150">150</a>. <span class="smcap">Knot</span>: Senna. Number to the inch horizontally
sixteen, vertically eighteen, to the square inch two hundred eighty-eight.
The predominating color throughout is a beautiful terracotta.
The four diamond forms through the centre are filled with
geometrical figures in buff and terracotta upon a dark blue
ground. Of the semi-diamond forms the first and third upper and
the second lower have an old ivory background, while the second
upper and the first and third lower have a background of a most beautiful
buff shade. The figures on all of these are in blue, terracotta
and white. The first and third border stripes carry an S form on
the top and bottom, while on the sides they carry a form of barber-pole
stripe, all upon a dark blue background. The main border
stripe carries a peculiar rectilineal eight-petaled flower in different
colors upon an old ivory background; the loose yarn ends hanging
alternate in red and blue every four inches. The color combination
and sheen of this piece are unexcelled.</span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Stanton Rug</span> (page <a href="#Page_162">162</a>).&mdash;The predominating dark mahogany
color and long thick nap, together with a touch of blue in the octagons,
makes this piece most attractive. See also frontispiece.</span></p>

<h4>YOMUD</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonyms.</span>&mdash;Yamoud, Yamut. Sometimes
called yellow or brown Bokhara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why So Named.</span>&mdash;After a tribe of Nomadic
Turkomans by that name who dwell in the western
part of Turkestan on the plains along the shores
of the Caspian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot.</span>&mdash;Either the Senna or the Ghiordes.
Number vertically eight to fifteen; number horizontally
seven to twelve; number to square inch
fifty-six to one hundred eighty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warp.</span>&mdash;Brown wool or goats' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woof.</span>&mdash;Good wool of medium length or goats'
hair. Frequently dyed red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Fine wool of medium length or goats'
hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;A coarse selvage of two cords which
are colored in alternate squares of red and blue,
red and brown, or two shades of red, giving it a
checker-board effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;A wide web at each end in plain red or
with blue stripes. Frequently stripes of colored
wool are worked into the web with apparently as
much care and skill as that given to the body of
the rug. Finished with a fringe of loose warp
threads which are occasionally twisted at irregular
intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg. 286]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Border.</span>&mdash;There are usually three border
stripes, one medium sized one with a narrow one
on each side. The barber-pole stripe, the reciprocal
saw-teeth, and the latch hook variations are
the predominating border designs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevailing Colors.</span>&mdash;Ground almost invariably
of a rich brownish red which is softer and
deeper in tone than that of the Khivas and Tekkes.
Figures in drab, blue, green, and yellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyes.</span>&mdash;Usually the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Designs.</span>&mdash;The tribal patterns show great individuality
and combine the Turkoman octagon
with many of the Caucasian designs. A common
arrangement is that of octagons and elongated
diamond forms in alternate rows with plenty of
latch hook variations. Very frequently the field
is covered with the diamond forms alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices.</span>&mdash;From $0.75 to $2.50 per square foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sizes.</span>&mdash;Seldom smaller than five by eight or
larger than eight by eleven feet.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;They resemble the Bokharas in
some respects and the Caucasian products in
others. About the only antique, in carpet sizes,
now found in the market.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor"><span class="smcap">Maj. L. B. Lawton's Description.</span>&mdash;This weave is the
rarest of the Turkomans. So rare is it that Mr. Mumford in his
article in the <i>Century Magazine</i>, January, 1910, states that to his
knowledge no bales of antique Yomuds had been imported for
seven years. Nearly all Yomuds have the cross pattern, are
usually deeper in tone than their cousins the prayer Bokharas,
and lack the little niche. Yomuds are silkier than prayer Bokharas,
and have the color of the Delaware grape. This specimen has
an unique pattern as a panel across the end, otherwise it is
typical. Yomuds adhere more closely to their type than do
any other weave.</span></p>

      well understood, are the finest products of the Persian looms.</span></p>
    <p class="left"><span class="small">The &quot;barber pole&quot; stripes in the border, the reciprocal Van
      Dyke design, and the &quot;wine glass&quot; figure in the widest border are
      all characteristic designs found in Caucasian rugs. Even the niche
      is similar to other Daghestan prayer rugs. But we see at once
      Persian influences in the field of the rug.</span></p>
    <p class="left"><span class="small">The &quot;flame&quot; design as it is called here, which is in reality a
      variation of the familiar &quot;river loop&quot; or &quot;El-Ayassi&quot; pattern,
      and which is distinctly a Persian figure, is here used throughout
      the field. As if to emphasize the theory that the flame, which
      the early Persians worshipped, is represented by this design, each
      individual figure is made to give off rays of light and warmth.</span></p>
    <p class="left"><span class="small">Another interesting and noticeable feature in this rug is that
      while in Persian fabrics like the Sereband, where this or a very
      similar design is used, the figures are almost all exactly alike,

<h2>THE BELUCHISTAN RUGS</h2>


<p class="pmb3">Beluchistan is a vast, wild and mountainous
country extending from Kirman to India and from
Afghanistan to the South Arabian Sea, partly
under Persian rule and partly under the protection
of Great Britain. It has an area of
about 146,000 square miles with but 800,000 population.
The capital, Kelat, has a population of
15,000. The inhabitants are principally Nomad
tribes of primitive habits and of the Mohammedan
faith. The rugs of Beluchistan are taken way
across Afghanistan to Bokhara to be marketed.
On this account and also because of their great
likeness to the Turkoman products they are classified
as such by several prominent writers. Like
the latter they invariably have a wide web at each
end, usually with a woven design. The colors and
designs are similar to those of the Turkoman class
and the dyes are good, but nowadays unwashed
ones are extremely scarce.</p>

<h4>BELUCHISTAN</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonyms.</span>&mdash;Balooch, Baloochee, Bilooz, Bilouche,
etc. Sometimes wrongly called "Blue
Bokhara."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Whom Made.</span>&mdash;By the Nomadic tribes of
Beluchistan and by Beluches residing in Afghanistan
and Eastern Persia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nap.</span>&mdash;Fine, long, compact, lustrous wool,
goats' and camels' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sides.</span>&mdash;Overcast or selvaged, usually with
goats' or horses' hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ends.</span>&mdash;Wide ornamented selvage with loose
or twisted warp ends. Often a row of colored
yarns run through the web.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHINA</h2>
</div>


<p class="center">CHINESE RUGS.</p>


<p>It is practically within the last decade or so
that the artistic merits of the Chinese rugs have
been fully appreciated. Previous to that time
they were promptly laid aside to make place for
the other Oriental weaves. A few wise connoisseurs
were in the meantime securing all the
choice pieces available and some have made themselves
independently wealthy by their sagacious
forethought. At the present time Chinese rugs
are eagerly sought and treasured more than those
of any other class, good ones bringing fabulous
prices.</p>

<p>To illustrate the rapid advance in the value of
choice pieces the writer will relate one incident
out of many similar ones which to his knowledge
have occurred.</p>

<p>About eighteen years ago a wealthy horseman
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg. 302]</a></span>
of Central New York died leaving a stable which,
together with its furnishings, was worth many
thousands of dollars. Sometime after his death
the furnishings were sold at public auction.
Among the articles thus disposed of was a Chinese
rug 10 Ã— 12 which was bid in by a New York man
for $150.00. Two years ago it was resold for
$25,000.</p>

<p>Excluding those of recent make, Chinese rugs
are of good workmanship and honest dyes, the
weavers being little influenced by modern ideas,
consequently they are durable and, on account of
their original Mongolian designs, can easily be
distinguished from the other Oriental products.
Unfortunately, on account of the growing scarcity
of wool in China and on account of foreign invasion,
the rug industry seems to be dying out.</p>

<p>The classification of Chinese rugs is a difficult
matter, in fact anything like an accurate classification
is impossible even for a connoisseur for they
cannot be assigned to the different provinces by
the finish of their sides and ends as are the other
Oriental weaves, but the classification must depend
mostly upon the colors, materials and workmanship,
which were in vogue at certain periods,
as well as the effect of time upon these colors
and materials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg. 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Those which reach our own shores are generally
divided into three classes according to the
districts from which they came, namely, Pekin,
Tientsin and Thibet, the latter being practically
Chinese although not geographically so. The
above are named in order of their excellence, the
finest pieces, as a rule, coming from northern
China.</p>

<p>Unlike other Oriental textiles those of China
may be interestingly classified according to the
symbolism of their designs, thus we may have the
longevity rug in which are depicted the crane, the
stork, the deer, or the tortoise, all of which are
symbols of longevity. The literary rug is decorated
with books, ink stands, pencils, brushes,
scrolls, and sceptres. The bat, the gourd, the
circle of happiness, and the shou denote happiness;
the dragon, the lion, the ph&#339;nix, and the
sword authority and power; the swastika, the
knot of destiny, the swallow, and the magpie are
symbols of good luck, while in the religious rugs
are found the rosary, the incense burner and
various altar implements.</p>

<p>The Chinese weaver is fond of filling every
available space with objects with which he comes
in daily contact, thus among the animate things
may be mentioned butterflies, dogs, doves, ducks
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg. 304]</a></span>
and swans. Among the inanimate things are
vases, chess boards, jars, stands, baskets, wheels,
ribbons, shells, pots and plates, while among the
flowers are the peony, the primrose, the peach,
the magnolia and tea blossom, the lotus, the
orchid, the chrysanthemum, the sun flower and
the aster.</p>

<p>There are seven designs, which on account of
the great frequency with which they are used, are
worthy of special mention. Named in order of
their employment, they are the circle of happiness,
the Chinese fret, the swastika, the butterfly, the
bat, the shou, and the dragon.</p>

<p>The circle of happiness which is found in
nearly all classes of Chinese rugs is a circle or
ovoid within which are worked various Mongolian
designs. The Chinese, or Greek fret, as it is
sometimes called, is a border design suggested
by the overlapping of the sea waves and is found
in fully two-thirds of the Chinese products. The
swastika needs little explanation other than the
statement that for centuries it has symbolized
good luck to many tribes in distant parts of the
world. Butterflies, symbols of vanity, are frequently
found intermingled with flowers or bats,
the latter being symbolic of happiness. The shou,
which stands for prosperity, has nearly a hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg. 305]</a></span>
different forms, many of which are similar in
shape to the Egyptian scarab. The dragon, the
Chinese symbol for sovereignty, always has five
claws, unlike the Japanese dragon, which has but
three. It is frequently represented as holding or
looking towards a round object, the so-called
"chin" or jewel.</p>

<p>The materials from which the Chinese make
their rugs are practically the same as are used
in the other rug making countries with perhaps
the exception that the wool varies more in quality,
being on an average considerably coarser than
that of Persia or Anatolia. The Chinese also
employ considerable hair, which in appearance
very much resembles that of a cow. Rugs made of
this hair are known as Yak rugs.</p>

<p>Chinese weaving differs little from that of
other parts of the Orient. Both the Senna and the
Ghiordes knots are employed, most frequently
the former, but the appearance is different on
account of the size and looseness of the warp and
pile yarn, which, in many instances, makes it
impossible for the weaver to tie over eight to ten
knots to the square inch. During the early part
of the eighteenth century, designs were frequently
made to stand out in relief by cutting somewhat
shorter the wool around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg. 306]</a></span></p>

<p>Chinese designs are characteristic and interesting,
being similar to those found in the old
Chinese porcelains. As a rule they are simple,
with little detail and are outlined with a contrasting
color. No family or tribal designs are
employed as in the other rug making countries.
Each rug being usually the work of one weaver,
both in design and execution, it is frequently
symbolic of his creed.</p>

<p>During the 16th and 17th centuries the
majority of Chinese rugs had a field of solid color
or were covered with the trellis design. They also
had but few narrow border stripes, either in plain
colors or carrying simple geometric designs, but
about the middle of the 18th century, they began
to show Persian influence, floral patterns being
adopted especially for the borders.</p>

<p>Like the designs, the colors employed by the
weavers are quite similar to those used in the old
porcelains. As a rule, they are dull, warm and
harmonious, but few shades being used in the
same piece.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The colors and shades most frequently used
in Chinese rugs, named in order of their employment,
are dark blue, yellow, light blue, apricot,
ivory white, dark brown, cream, old red, tan,
fawn, robin's egg blue, green, fruit red, persimmon
red, ash white, sapphire blue, peach blow,
salmon pink, brownish red, brick red, greenish
yellow, turquoise blue, copper pink, and black.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The different shades are of considerable assistance
to the connoisseur in estimating the age of a
rug, for instance, robin's egg blue, golden brown,
and tan were mostly in vogue during the 17th century,
and during that period, green and lemon
citron, greenish and reddish yellows were never
employed.</p>

<h2>GHILEEMS, SILKS, AND FELTS</h2>
<p class="pmb1" />

<h3>GHILEEMS</h3>


<p>Also spelled Gileem, Gilim, Khilim, Kilim,
Killim. A pileless rug which is made by binding
a dyed weft thread around the warp threads by
means of a shuttle or needle, making the fabric
alike on both sides and leaving open spaces between
the warp threads where the changes of
color are made. This is the primitive mode of
weaving and requires much more skill than does
the pile method. Ghileems are woven at the
present day more than ever all over the Caucasus,
Anatolia, Kurdistan, Persia, and in some
parts of Turkestan. Those which are found in
the Western markets come mostly from CÃ¦sarea,
Senna, Shirvan, Kurdistan, and Merve.</p>

<p class="pmb3">As a rule each variety adopts the designs and
colors which are in vogue in the particular locality
from which they come, but frequently the border
stripes do not extend around the whole fabric as
is almost invariably the rule with the pile carpets.
By the Oriental the Ghileems have been used as
floor coverings from the earliest times; by the
Occidental they are used almost exclusively as
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg. 312]</a></span>
portiÃ¨res, couch covers, and table spreads. As a
rule, they are sold in the Orient by weight, and,
like most of the other textiles, have of late years
not been extremely free from outside influences.</p>


<h4>SENNA GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Senna Ghileem is the finest quality of Ghileem
produced, being much finer in texture than
any of the other Ghileems. As a rule they have
small intricate patterns, with an opening at each
change of color, in fact they are exact duplicates
of the Senna pile rugs in design and have the same
finish on the sides and ends. The Herati design is
commonly used in the field but seldom in the
border. In sizes they vary from three and one-half
to four and one-half by five and one-half to
seven feet, seldom larger or smaller.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">The main border stripe carries a meandering vine with a
pear-shaped leaf at each turn and on either side of it is a narrow
stripe consisting of floral forms which are connected by leaves
arranged in the form of a meander.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>ANATOLIAN GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Anatolian Ghileems are, as a rule, light in
weight and coarse in texture, with many open
spaces and with bold geometrical Turkish designs
and bright colors. They are made of good wool
and are finished with a fringe at each end. As a
rule they can be distinguished by their prayer
niche or by a seam through the centre, the larger
sizes, which do not come in the prayer design,
usually being made by sewing two long, narrow
pieces together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg. 313]</a></span></p>


<h4>KIS GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Kis Ghileem, which means "girl rug," are
Turkish Ghileems made by the Mohammedan girls
for their suitors, it being a Turkish custom for a
girl, as soon as she becomes engaged, to weave
one of these rugs to present to her future husband
in order to show the quality of her handiwork;
therefore, being judged to a certain extent by the
grade of her weaving, she naturally does her best.
For this reason many of the so-called Kis Ghileems
are of excellent workmanship. They carry typical
Turkish designs and are finished with a fringe at
each end. In size they vary from two and one-half
to seven by four to fifteen feet, the smaller sizes
usually being of the prayer style, while the larger
ones are made of two parts sewed together, little
care being taken to make the patterns of the two
pieces match well. Frequently we will find small
tufts of wool, beads or a lock of the weaver's hair
attached to the warp threads as a talisman.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg. 314]</a></span></p>


<h4>SHIRVAN GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Shirvan Ghileems are always recognized by
their designs, which are like those of no other
Ghileem, being composed of numerous stripes running
across the whole width of the rug and covered
with geometrical devices similar to those of
the Daghestan. These stripes are from eight to
twelve inches wide with narrow plain blue, green,
or red stripes between. They are nearly always
woven in one piece and of good wool, but are heavy
and coarse, with large openwork spaces. In size
they vary from three to eight by six to twelve feet,
the average being five by nine feet.</p>


<h4>KURDISH GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Kurdish Ghileems, like other Kurdish rugs,
rank among the best of their class, being made of
the finest of wool and closely woven. They usually
consist of two or more pieces sewed together or
joined by embroidered geometrical designs and
many yarn ends are left loose on the under side,
giving a shaggy appearance like the under side of
the Shemakha rugs. In this respect they are
unlike any of the other Ghileems. The colors are
as a rule subdued, dark shades of crimson, blue,
yellow, and green, with more or less black and
white. The prayer design is frequent, with a niche
like that of the Ghiordes. The ends are finished
with a web upon which an attractive design is
woven or through which runs a parti-colored
thread similar to that in other Kurdish rugs. The
antiques are very scarce. In sizes they vary from
four to six by seven to twelve feet.</p>

<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">This is one of two strips which were originally sewed
together like many of the Ghileems of this class. The predominating
colors are green, red, dark brown and white. Each
end is finished with a short web and braided warp threads. It
also has many loose yarn ends on the back side, which is a
characteristic feature of the Kurdish Ghileems.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>MERVE GHILEEM</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Merve Ghileems are made in the vicinity of
Merve, in the Turkoman district. They differ from
all other Ghileems in that the colors are divided
diagonally instead of vertically or horizontally
with the warp or woof threads. For this reason
no open spaces are left. The colors are few and
subdued, white especially being seldom used, and
in design they are most modest, the field as a rule
being divided transversely into three or four parts
by ornate line patterns resembling in some respects
the Kurdish Ghileems. They frequently
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg. 316]</a></span>
come in prayer form with designs less striking
than those of the Kurdish Ghileems and strongly
resembling those of the Beluchistan. Some are of
great size.</p>


<h5>THE EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATED</h5>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3"><span class="minor">One of two strips which were originally sewed together.
Like many of its class the field of this piece is divided transversely
into a number of stripes, each about a foot wide. Each
stripe is of a different color, being tan, green, white and brown,
and the whole field is covered with a trellis of serrated latch
hook designs in red, the divisions of which contain diamond
forms in different colors. There is a short web at each end,
one with loose warp threads and the other knotted.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<h4>SILK RUGS</h4>

<p>Silk rugs were first made in China and afterwards
in Anatolia and Northern Persia, where
silk is produced in great quantities. They were
formerly made for mosques, for royalty, or for
very rich people, expert weavers being hired for
the occasion and the material being furnished by
the one who ordered the work done.</p>

<p>Fine silk rugs are unsurpassed in beauty, rich,
exquisite coloring, and rare sheen, but they have
never been practical as floor coverings; first,
because they require such luxurious surroundings,
and second, because the wearing quality of
silk does not compare with that of wool.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The genuine Persian silk rugs are getting
scarce and almost priceless. Strange as it may
seem, few of these pieces have been sought by
either the museums or collectors of America.</p>

<p>Those made at Kashan in Northern Persia are
the best of the present day products. As a rule
they are made entirely of silk having a narrow
web and a fringe of loose warp threads at each end
and with beautiful shades of red, rose, turquoise,
old ivory, and green.</p>

<p>In Persia they sell for from $10.00 to $15.00
per square foot and in the United States for from
$15.00 to several hundred dollars a square foot.</p>

<p>A much cheaper and a purely commercial
product comes from Kaisarieh or CÃ¦sarea, in Asia
Minor. These, as a rule, have a cotton warp and
weft and are copied after the old Persian and
Ghiordes designs, especially the so-called
"Mosque design" with the hanging lamp. These
rugs are undesirable in color, dyes and workmanship
and are invariably worth much less than the
prices asked for them. The great majority of
them can be detected by the direction in which
the pile runs, it being inclined towards the top
instead of towards the bottom.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is easy to go astray in the purchase of silk
rugs on account of the numerous mercerized and
wool silk imitations, many of them not even being
hand-tied but machine made.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg. 318]</a></span></p>


<h4>FELT RUGS</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Felt rugs are made to a certain extent in
nearly every part of Persia, but chiefly at Ispahan,
Astrabad, and Yezd. They are made of wool,
goats' hair or camels' hair or of a combination of
two or all of these substances, according to the
color desired. As no dyes are employed and the
finished product is the same in color as that of
the materials used, they are usually gray, white
or buff, most frequently the latter. The material
is matted together by being pounded, occasionally
sprinkled with water in which rapeseed-oil cakes
have been soaked for a long time, and then
pounded more until it becomes compact and solid.
The finished product varies in thickness from
three-quarters of an inch to three inches and is as
soft and pliable as cloth, but too heavy for exportation,
consequently few come to Western markets.
In the Orient they are used as floor coverings on
top of which ordinary pile carpets are placed. In
this country they have been used in bedrooms,
also as a covering for dining tables, and as silence
cloths, but they will not stand the wear of chairs
and are an easy mark for moths. They can be
purchased for from $7.00 to $10.00 per yard.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO
THEIR INTENDED USE</h2>


<h3>PRAYER RUGS (NAMAZLIK)</h3>

<p>In all ages fine rugs have been used for religious
purposes by the faithful followers of the
prophet. Every Mohammedan has his prayer rug,
more or less valuable according to his means,
which he always carries with him and upon which
he prostrates himself five times a day when the
appointed hour for prayer arrives.</p>

<p>By means of a small compass he spreads his
rug so that the mihrab or niche points towards
Mecca, where Mohammed's body lies. Then after
removing all jewelry and money from his person,
in order to appear before God in the most abject
humility, he combs his beard, produces a rosary
of ninety-nine beads and a dried cake of earth
which came from Mecca. These he places just
under the niche and then, resting his head on the
earth with his hands outstretched on either side,
he performs his devotions.</p>

<p>The mihrab or niche on which the worshipper
places his head represents the door of a mosque
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg. 322]</a></span>
and reminds those who use it of the sacred mosque
at Mecca.</p>

<p>Occasionally prayer rugs will be found with
three or more niches, especially among the Caucasian
products. These are intended for children
or for family worship. Others may have instead
of a prayer niche, three small medallions, one
each for the hands and one to receive the forehead.</p>

<p>For convenience the prayer rug is of small size,
usually from two and one-half to four by four to
six feet. Those intended for personal use frequently
have the name of the owner on and are of
the very best workmanship. Combs and other
objects used in the act of worship are frequently
depicted in or near the prayer niche.</p>

<p>The prayer niche takes various forms in different
kinds of rugs, seldom more than one class
having the same form. As a rule that of the Persians
is formed by curved lines, while all others
are formed by straight lines, those of both the
Persian and Turkish classes being pointed, while
those of the Caucasian and Turkoman classes may
either be pointed or flat at the top, usually the
latter.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In differentiating between these different
classes we are assisted not only by the shape of
the mihrab, but also by the various field designs,
such for instance as the panels above and below
the prayer field, the lanterns or pendants which
hang from the centre of the niche, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Single Panels.</span>&mdash;When only one panel is used
it is invariably above the prayer field. The Kulah
nearly always has but one, the Anatolian generally,
and the Ghiordes seldom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double Panels.</span>&mdash;The Ghiordes nearly always
has two, the Bergama generally, and the Kulah
seldom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanging pendants</span> are always present in the
Kaisarieh, frequently in the Ghiordes, and seldom
in the Kulah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pillars</span> are always present in the Kaisarieh,
frequently in the Kulah, and only occasionally in
the Ghiordes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plain prayer fields</span> (excepting the lamp) are
most frequent in the Turkish rugs.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">Filled prayer fields</span> are invariably present in
the Caucasian and Turkoman rugs and generally
in the Persians.</p>


<h4>HEARTH RUGS (ODJAKLIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Hearth rugs may be distinguished by the shape
of their field, each end of which resembles the
niche of the prayer rugs belonging to the same
class. They are usually from three and one-half
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg. 324]</a></span>
to four by five to seven feet and are very precious
to the family, who always spread them before the
fire upon the arrival of a guest, and once a fugitive,
fleeing from his enemies, enters a tent and
sets his foot upon the hearth rug, the owner and
his people were bound to defend him.</p>


<h4>GRAVE RUGS (TURBEHLIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Grave rugs are usually the combined handiwork
of all the members of the household and, in
accordance with an ancient custom, are used to
cover the dead before interment and the grave
after interment, having practically the same
import as flowers do with us. They are usually
woven in sombre tints to express grief and in
light colors to denote resurrection. The cypress
tree, which is symbolic of sorrow, is usually the
leading feature of the design and there are generally
some inscriptions from the Koran.</p>


<h4>DOWRY OR WEDDING RUGS (KIS GHILEEM)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Dowry or wedding rugs are woven by the
Eastern maiden for her dowry. They are usually
small in size and are seldom seen in America, as
they are always greatly prized by the Oriental.
A more definite description of them will be found
under the heading of Ghileems.</p>

<h4>MOSQUE OR MECCA RUGS</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Mosque or Mecca rugs are sometimes called
Tribute rugs. The wealthy Mohammedan rulers
vied with each other in taking with them on their
pilgrimage to Mecca rugs of the finest materials
and choicest designs for presentation to the
mosque, the whole interior of which was usually
hung with carpets, beautiful and costly beyond
description. Many of these so-called mosque rugs
were of the Shiraz class. It is still the custom
in some parts of the Orient to give rugs to the
mosque as thank offerings for special blessings
received and frequently the Mohammedan bequeaths
a rug when he dies to the mosque where
he worshipped.</p>
<div class="pmb3"></div>


<h4>BATH RUGS (HAMMANLIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Bath rugs are usually about three feet square
and have a peculiar lustre due to their frequent
contact with soap and water. One of these bath
rugs is usually presented to the bride by her
parents on her wedding day.</p>
<div class="pmb3"></div>


<h4>PILLOW CASES (YESTEKLIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Pillow cases are known in the United States as
Anatolian mats and are described as such in the
chapter on Turkish Classification.</p>
<div class="pmb3"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg. 326]</a></span></p>


<h4>SAMPLE CORNERS</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Sample corners are mats about two feet square
and are woven for the purpose of showing the
variation of border, color, and design to some
wealthy ruler who wishes a carpet woven. They
are afterwards used in the weaver's family and
seldom reach the market. (See p. <a href="#Page_328">328</a>.)</p>
<div class="pmb3"></div>


<h4>SADDLE BAGS (HEHBELIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Saddle bags always come in pieces of varying
widths, according to the kind of animal for which
they are intended. Those intended for donkeys
usually run from one to one and one-half by one
and one-half to two feet, while those intended for
horses or camels usually run from one and one-half
to two and one-half by five to six feet or more.
Those from Persia and Anatolia are usually
small and nearly square, while those from Bokhara
and Beluchistan are usually large and oblong.
These saddle bags are quite appropriate for bachelor
apartments, artists' studios, or smoking
rooms and are sometimes used on a suitable
standard as a newspaper or magazine receptacle.

<h4>SADDLE COVER (SEMERLIK)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Saddle covers are used by the wealthy class.
They are nearly square, ranging from two and
one-half to three by four to four and one-half feet,
and have an opening at one end for the pommel
of the saddle to pass through. The finest ones
are from Senna.</p>


<h4>FLOOR COVERINGS</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Sedjadeh is the Persian name applied to those
of the larger size, while Hali is the name applied
to those of medium size. Oriental carpets are of
modern make with very few exceptions, most of
them being just as well made as were the antiques,
although they show considerable deterioration in
dyes. Those which are commonly found in the
Western market are the Feraghans, Gorevans,
Hamadans, Kermanshahs, Khorasans, Kirmans,
Kurdistans, Sarabands, Sennas, Sultanabads, and
Tabriz among the Persians; the Kazaks and
Shemakhas among the Caucasians; the Gulistans,
Oushaks, and Smyrnas among the Turkish; and
the Khivas and Yomuds among the Turkoman.
Large rugs cost more per square foot, as a rule,
than the small ones, as their size makes heavier
construction imperative and increases the difficulty
of weaving as well as the amount of yarn
required.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg. 328]</a></span></p>


<h4>RUNNERS (KENNAR)</h4>

<p class="pmb3">Runners properly belong to this class, as they
are used in the Orient mostly to lay along the
sides of a room. In this country they have been
found extremely convenient as hall rugs.</p>

<p class="pmb3">To this class belong all of the silk rugs as
well as many of the delicately colored and extremely
light fabrics, especially those that picture
gardens and portraits or have on them quotations
from the Koran. Ghileems may also be classed
under this head.</p>

<h2>FAMOUS RUGS</h2>


<p>The interest in the very old weavings is not
as manifest in the American cities as in many of
the European cities, such for instance as Vienna,
London, Paris, and Berlin. This is due to several
reasons. In the first place, Europe began the
importation of Oriental textiles many years before
the United States did. In the second place, most
of the choice pieces in the United States belong
to private individuals instead of to museums, consequently
they are seldom, if ever, seen by the
public. In the third place, many of the European
cities, especially London and Vienna, have given
a number of public exhibitions of old rugs, while
the recent exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of
Fine Arts in New York City was the first one
ever held in the United States. At this exhibit
there were forty-seven pieces of the 14th, 15th,
16th, 17th and 18th centuries, pieces that would
compare favorably with those of any country, all
owned by private collectors in the Eastern States.</p>

<p>Great credit is due Dr. Wm. R. Valentiner
and his assistants for the promotion and successful
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg. 332]</a></span>
management of this exhibition. Let us hope
that it is but the beginning of a series of such
exhibits which will stimulate a more formal interest
and desire to know more about these wonderful
products of the Eastern loom.</p>

<p>The age of old rugs can be at least as accurately
determined as the age of old paintings and
in many cases even more so. According to Dr.
Valentiner the so-called Polanaise and Ispahan
rugs belong to the 17th century and the Persian
animal or hunting rugs belong to the 16th century,
while the so-called dragon rugs belong to the 15th
century. Many of the rugs from Armenia and the
eastern part of Asia Minor date back as far as the
13th and 14th centuries.</p>

<p>Every old rug has its individual character
manifest by its designs, colors, weave, and material,
all of which are peculiar to the time when it
was made or the locality in which it was made, so
that it can be located and dated with greater
accuracy than would be supposed.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Many early rugs were used for decorative purposes
in the pictures of the early Italian and
Flemish painters.</p>

<p class="p3">According to recognized authorities the so-called
Polish carpets were not woven in Poland
at all, but were products of Persia, and the so-called
Ispahan rugs were not made at Ispahan or
even in Persia, but came from the city of Herat
in Western Afghanistan. Of the former several
hundred are still in existence, the best of which
are in the European courts and museums, about
forty being in the United States, while nearly
every collection contains one or more of the
Herats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ardebil Carpet.</span>&mdash;Without a doubt the
most famous Oriental carpet now known is the
mosque carpet of Ardebil owned by the South
Kensington Museum in London.</p>

<p>It is a Persian masterpiece and was made in
1536 by one Maksoud for the Ardebil Mosque. In
size it is thirty-four and one-half by seventeen and
one-half feet and contains in the neighborhood of
32,000,000 knots, about 530 to the square inch,
and was purchased by the South Kensington
Museum for $12,500, although, if put up at auction
to-day, it would doubtless bring many times that
sum. The ground is of a rich blue and is covered
with the most intricate of old Persian floral
designs. It has a central medallion in pale yellow
with corners to match. There are three border
stripes, one wide one with a narrow one on either
side of it. The ground of the outer stripe is of a
tawny yellow with small floral designs; the ground
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg. 334]</a></span>
of the inner stripe is cream colored and that of the
main stripe is of a rich brown with round and
elongated panels alternating and surrounded by
a profusion of floral lines. Within these panels
are to be found in Arabic the following inscription:
"I have no refuge in the world other than
thy threshold; My head has no protection other
than this porch way; The work of the slave of the
Holy place, Maksoud of Kashan." In the year
942 (which corresponds to A.D. 1536.)<a id="FNAnker_B_2"></a><a href="#Fussnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dragon and Ph&#339;nix Rug</span> of the Kaiser
Frederich Museum, Berlin, is a Central Asia
Minor weave of the 14th century and is probably
the oldest existing rug that has been identified
with the representation of a similar fabric in a
painting. It was purchased for the Berlin
museum by Dr. Bode, from a church in Central
Italy on account of its resemblance to a rug in the
fresco painting representing the "Marriage of
the Foundlings," one of the series painted by
Domenico di Bartolo in Spedale di Santa Maria
della Scala in Senna about 1440.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In design it represents a dragon and a ph&#339;nix
in deadly combat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Austrian Royal Hunting Carpet.</span>&mdash;Next
in prominence to the Ardebil Carpet comes the
Royal Hunting Carpet of the Austrian Imperial
and Royal Court, which is said to have been presented
by Peter the Great. It is a Persian rug of
great antiquity and shows Chinese influence in the
design, which includes elaborately woven horsemen
in pursuit of deer and other animals and
winged gods in contest with lions and buffaloes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Indian Hunting Rug</span> of the Boston Museum
of Fine Arts is perhaps the most noted of
the forty-seven pieces which were in the recent
Metropolitan exhibit. It was made in India about
1640, is eight feet three inches long by five feet
three inches wide and contains about three hundred
and sixty knots to the square inch. Its predominating
color is red. In the upper left-hand
corner are a couple of buildings in which are
seated in Oriental style several individuals. Below
these buildings are several deer, a chained
leopard in a cart drawn by a bullock, hunters, a
winged elephant, tigers, and goats, all of which
are interspersed with floral and tree forms.
There are three border stripes, the centre one of
which is the wider and carries leaf-shaped panels
containing faces. Each one of these panels is
separated by a bird and small floral forms upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg. 336]</a></span>
a cream-colored ground. The two narrow stripes
carry designs in light and dark blue, pink and red.
This rug was purchased at $35,000 by the late
Governor Ames of Massachusetts and presented
to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><span class="smcap">The Altman Prayer Rug</span>, owned by Mr.
Benjamin Altman of New York City, was made in
North Persia about 1580. It is similar to one
which was in the Yerkes sale and to another one
which was shown at the recent Munich exhibition
of Mohammedan art. It has beautiful floral
designs with arabesques and Chinese motifs in
deep shades of red, blue, and yellow, many of the
designs being worked with light yellow or silver
thread in the ghileem style. The Mihrab is the
Persian style, from which hangs a mosque lamp
which is covered with red, yellow, and pink flowers
on a green ground. The lower part of the field
is covered with various floral and tree forms in
yellow with pink blossoms. There are two
border stripes. The inner one has a yellow
ground, the lower part of which is covered with
arabesques and the upper part with Arabic inscriptions
in blue which read "May the Blessing
of God rest upon them all. There is no God but
Allah (the true God); Mohammed is the prophet
of God. Ali is the saint of God. God the exalted
one says: Verily God and His angel shower their
blessings upon the prophet. Oh ye faithful send
your blessings with Him, as well as offer your
salutations unto Him." The outer border has a
blue ground upon which are rounded octagons
and oblong panels in gray, the latter containing
inscriptions from the Koran in black. Size five
feet five inches by three feet three inches.</p>

at p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>), from the Ardebil Mosque, was
made in Northern Persia about 1530. It was purchased
by the Metropolitan Museum of Art from
the Yerkes collection. On a claret colored ground
are the repeated figures of a lion, a jackal, and a
spotted deer in deadly combat. There are also
running boars amid a profusion of flowers.
There are three border stripes, a wide one with a
narrow one on either side. The former is filled
with arabesques and cloud bands in blue and pink
on a ground of dark blue. The inner stripe carries
a green design on a yellow ground and the
outer stripes carry a floral design on a red ground.
In size it is ten feet eleven inches long by five feet

four hundred knots to the square inch.</p>

New York City, is also one of the four famous
mosque rugs of Ardebil. It was woven
about the middle of the 16th century; it is about
fourteen by six feet and contains upwards of five
hundred knots to the square inch. It is a harmonious
blending of red, blue, green, pink, brown,
old rose, cream, white, and silver, the predominating
color of the field being a dark red. It has
three central medallions, one large one and a
smaller one just above and below it, with a quarter
segment of a cusped circle in each corner of the
field to match. Intermediate spaces are filled with
flowering branches, fish and animals, the latter
being worked with silver thread in the ghileem
stitch. There is one wide border stripe with a
narrow one on either side. The former has a back
of cream and carries alternately round and oblong
medallions which contain verses from the Koran
in silver.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
